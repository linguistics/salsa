        <h1>About SALSA</h1>
        <p>The Symposium About Language and Society (SALSA) is an annual
           symposium promoting linguistic, linguistic anthropological and
           communication research at the University of Texas at Austin.
           Originally created through the joint efforts of students from the
           Linguistic, Anthropology and Communication Studies Departments at the
           University of Texas, SALSA has developed into an interdisciplinary
           conference with contributions from various fields, including foreign
           language education, educational psychology,          media studies,
           and numerous language departments. Our annual proceedings appear in
           special editions of Texas Linguistic Forum. </p>
