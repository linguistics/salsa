<h1>Call for papers</h1>

<p>
The annual Symposium About Language and Society, Austin (SALSA) is now accepting submissions for April 10-11th, 2020. 
  2020's theme <i>Texts in Circulation: Language, Power, and Identity</i> continues SALSAâ€™s tradition of promoting the study of
language and its intersection with society. Originally created through the joint efforts of students from the departments of
Linguistics, Anthropology, and Communication Studies at The University of Texas, SALSA grew as a transdisciplinary conference
  through presentations from a variety of fields, including foreign language education, educational psychology, media studies, 
  and the language departments of French &amp; Italian, Spanish &amp; Portuguese, German, and English. SALSA's annual 
  proceedings appear in special editions of the Texas Linguistic Forum.
</p>      

<p>The study of language and communication has focused on power and identity at multiple levels of linguistic expression, 
  such as: grammatical forms, rhetorical strategies, and full discourses. Power and identity interact with texts of any 
  modality, including written, signed, spoken, gestured, and visualized. <b>We welcome papers from all disciplines which 
  examine how power and identity are expressed through the medium of texts, and explore questions such as:</b></p>

<ul>
  <li>How are identities developed and expressed in different social situations?</li>
  <li>How do language ideologies influence social behavior?</li>
  <li>What rhetorical and poetic resources in language reflect particular linguistic or cultural groups? </li>
  <li>How can particular linguistic traditions and forms help us understand the nexus of  language, culture, and the individual?</li>
  <li>How can languages be revived, revitalized, and/or maintained through language policies and planning?</li>
  <li>In what ways do social media and other forms of mass media impact language use and change?</li>
  <li>How does political discourse transform societies?</li>
</ul>

<p>These topics are meant to serve as guideposts. Please feel free to submit
papers on other topics related to this year's theme.</p>
