<h1>Call for papers</h1>


<p>This year's conference theme is <b><i>Language in Society: Culture,
           Space, and Identity</i></b>.  Language is a distinctly human
       characterisitic, central to all human social organization.  It is the
       medium through which humans shape their identities, relate to one
       another, and construct social realities.  The conference will focus on
       the ways speakers from diverse sociohistorical and cultural backgrounds
       use language to negotiate their identities in particular spaces.  We
       welcome both diachronic and synchronic perspectives for the study of
       language in society.</p>      

<p>The conference will feature keynote addresses by:
<ul>
          <li>Dr. Jacqueline Urla (University of Massachusetts Amherst)</li>
                    <li>Dr. Richard Bourhis (Université du Québec à
                      Montréal)</li>
                                <li>Dr. James Slotta (University of Texas at
                                  Austin)</li>
                                            <li>Dr. Bob Bednar (Southwestern
                                              University)</li>
                                                  </ul>
</p>

<p>We encourage papers that address questions such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In what manner do different linguistic identities interact and evolve?</li>
  <li>How are identities developed and expressed in different social situations?</li>
  <li>How do language ideologies influence social behavior?</li>
  <li>What rhetorical and poetic resources in language reflect particular
    linguistic or cultural groups?</li>
  <li>How can particular linguistic traditions and forms help us understand the
  nexus of language, culture, and the individual?</li>
  <li>How do varying notions of space and place interact with language?</li>
  <li>How do technological spaces provide new linguistic opportunities?</li>
  <li>How do linguistic landscapes play a role in situations of language
    contact?</li>
  <li>How can languages be revived, revitalized, and/or maintained through
    language policies and planning?</li>
  <li>In what ways do social media and other forms of mass media impact language
  use and change?</li>
  <li>How does political discourse transform socieites?</li>
  <li>How can we use language to analyze the ideological underpinnings that
    shape and sustain the existence of borders?</li>
  <li>How can emerging political scenarios, such as Catalonia vis a vis Spain,
    inform us about the relationship between language, community and
    identity?</li>
