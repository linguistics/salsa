<h1>SALSA XXVIII: Canceled</h1>

<p>We sincerely regret to announce that, due to the coronavirus outbreak and the subsequent uncertainty surrounding travel plans and campus closures, we have decided to cancel SALSA XXVIII.  This was a difficult choice to make, and we hope to see you at next year's conference.  We will still put together a proceedings of accepted talks, so please stay tuned for information about that.</p>

<!-- <p><b>All presenters</b> should pre-register online <a href="registration.html">here</a>.  <b>General admission</b> is free for UT affiliates, who should register in person on the day of the event.</p> -->

          		<p><i><b>Reframing variable attainment in L2 acquisition</b></i></p>
          		<p>Variable attainment &mdash; "different learners, different outcomes" &mdash; is a hallmark of L2 acquisition (e.g. Bley-Vroman, 1990; cf. Dabrowska, 2012 for the L1 context). But there is more to the story of L2 attainment than individual differences. In this talk I consider evidence that permits new ways of framing variability in L2 outcomes.</p>
          		<p>From one new perspective, "same learners, different outcomes, I look at variability in the shape of the function that relates L2 attainment to age of acquisition, an area of considerable debate in critical-period theory (e.g. Birdsong, 2018; Meulman, 2015). From another angle, "more learners, different outcomes,"" I examine variable outcomes as a function of statistical power (e.g. Munson &amp; Hernandez, 2018). Merging these perspectives, I propose ways of approaching (ir)reproducibility of critical-period effects in L2 acquisition (v. Hartshorne, Tenenbaum &amp; Pinker, 2018; Tanner, 2018).</p>
          		<p>From the perspective of "different learners, similar outcomes" I examine instances where nativelikeness in the L2 is observed among learners from heterogeneous L1 backgrounds. Coefficient-of-variation data from a post-hoc analysis of data from Green and Birdsong (2018) are contextualized theoretically and methodologically within the larger question of comparing non-native variability with native variability (v. Birdsong &amp; Gertken, 2013; Vanhove, 2019). </p>

          		<p>David Birdsong is Professor of French Linguistics and chair of the Department of French and Italian at UT-Austin. He received the PhD in Romance Languages from Harvard University and has held the positions of Visiting Professor of Linguistics at Georgetown University, Visiting Research Fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in Nijmegen (NL), and International Chair, LABEX-Empirical Foundations of Linguistics in Paris.</p>
          		<p>His research relates to second language acquisition, bilingualism, psycholinguistics and French linguistics. His interests include the neurocognitive and experiential factors that influence ultimate attainment in a second language, and the measurement and predictive power of language dominance in bilingualism.</p>
          		<p>He has published in such journals as <i>Language</i>, <i>Journal of Memory &amp; Language</i>, <i>Frontiers in Psychology</i>, <i>Language Learning</i>, and <i>Language Sciences</i>, and in handbooks such as <i>The New Handbook of Second Language Acquisition</i>, <i>Handbook of Bilingualism: Psycholinguistic Approaches</i>, and <i>The Cambridge Handbook of Bilingualism</i>.</p>

        <h1>About SALSA</h1>
        <p>The Symposium About Language and Society, Austin (SALSA) is an annual
        symposium promoting the study of language and its intersection with society.  Originally created through the
        joint efforts of students from the Linguistics, Anthropology, and
        Communication Studies
        Departments at The University of Texas, SALSA has developed into an
        interdisciplinary
        conference with contributions from various fields, including foreign
        language education,
        educational psychology, media studies, and language departments,
        including French &amp; Italian,
        Spanish &amp; Portuguese, German, and English. Our conference
        proceedings appear in
        special editions of Texas Linguistic Forum.</p>
