      <p>This year's conference theme is <b><i>Language in Society: Culture,
           Space, and Identity</i></b>.  Language is a distinctly human
       characterisitic, central to all human social organization.  It is the
       medium through which humans shape their identities, relate to one
       another, and construct social realities.  The conference will focus on
       the ways speakers from diverse sociohistorical and cultural backgrounds
       use language to negotiate their identities in particular spaces.  We
       welcome both diachronic and synchronic perspectives for the study of
       language in society.  </p>
