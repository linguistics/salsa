              <p>Drawing from debates in activist anthropology (Hale 2008) as
              well as my own ethnographic research on minority language
              revitalization (Urla 2012; 2014), this lecture will explore some
              of the political, methodological and epistemological challenges
              posed by an activist stance to the study of language-based social
              struggles.  Foucault encouraged scholars to approach social
              struggles and their strategies of resistance as diagnostics of
              power rather than modes of “liberation” or shedding of power. In
              his view, it was the responsibility of critique to expose the
              unexamined assumptions on which the discursive practices of power
              and resistance rely.  In the pursuit of this goal, however, our
              analyses often clash with and undermine foundational premises
              about language and identity on which struggles for language rights
              rely.  How can we stay faithful to radical post-structural
              critique and also take the diagnosis of power to the next level? 
                 How can we go beyond the “reproduction thesis” – the idea that
                 strategies of minority language advocacy reproduce dominant
                 language ideology –that is so ubiquitous in scholarship on
                 language activism? What are some of the ways our knowledge
                 production can be made more generative for actors in such
                 movements and more cognizant of the complex nature of their
                 agency?  This lecture will contemplate the contours of such a
                 project and its challenges drawing from different case studies
                 including my own work on Basque language revitalization and
                 linguistic governmentality.</p>

              <p>Quebec is the only French majority society in North America
              whose provincial government succeeded in adopting its own language
              policies designed to increase the status and use of French
              relative to English in the province. Forty years of language
              planning in Quebec can in part be credited in having: 95% of the
              Quebec population gain knowledge of French, keeping 82% of all its
              citizens as users of French at home, keeping 97% of francophone
              pupils and 81% of Allophone pupils in the French school system,
              and reduce the size of the English school system by 60%.
              Pro-French laws ensured that 90% of  Francophone employees use
              French most often at work, increased to 67% the ownership of the
              Quebec economy by Francophones, increased Anglophone
              French/English bilingualism to over 70% and contributed to the
              decline of its Anglophones minority from 13% of the Quebec
              population to 8.3% after the net outmigration of 320K Anglophones
              from the province. Anglophones who stayed in Quebec earn lower
              incomes than those who left and experience the decline of their
              educational, health and community institutions. Francophone
              nationalist discourse  remains concerned about threats to French
              by highlighting that the Francophone majority in Montreal is
              declining close to 50% and that Francophones remain a minority of
              23% within Canada and less than 2% within North America. Can
                 Quebec Francophones of today accept a ‘paradigm shift’ by
                 reframing their position from a fragile majority to that of a
                 dominant majority within   Quebec?</p>

              <p>“Bubbles,” “silos,” “cocoons,” “echo chambers” are labels now
            commonly used by academics, media commentators, and citizens alike
            to lament the divided communicative condition of the US electorate.
            A topic of concern in recent presidential elections, the election of
            Donald Trump has only intensified worries over a populace seemingly
            segregated by the media ecosystems they engage with. Taken as an
            indicator of the state of liberal democracy in the US, such
            communicative anxieties bespeak the continued potency of the
            intertwined social and communicative imaginaries of an “American
            public” forged through a “national conversation” held in a
            Habermasian public sphere. At the same time, bubbles, silos, and
            cocoons disrupt this imaginary of a public, whose sine qua non after
            all is its inclusion of all citizens in the discursive life of the
            polity. The sorts of communicative practices and media technologies
            that make such an inclusive public sphere imaginable have been the
            topic of much discussion in linguistic anthropology and beyond. But
            how does a communicative imaginary of bubbles—a kind of anti-public
            sphere—take shape and acquire prominence? One significant catalyst,
            I argue here, is found in the speech of Donald Trump and
            particularly the incoherence so often attributed to it. The
            allusions of Trump’s rhetoric and their elusion of mainstream media
            audiences together serve to delineate the communicative bubbles in
            which mainstream media audiences no less than audiences of
            right-wing media have discovered themselves to be enclosed. As an
            increasingly compelling communicative imaginary of the polity, these
            anti-public spheres now serve as a framework through which people
            are re-orienting themselves to their fellow citizens and their
            future together.</p>

            <p>This presentation explores the challenges and rewards of
              transdisciplinary and transmedia scholarly and creative work
              focused on culture, space, and identity—especially when it
              critically engages individual and cultural trauma.  The
              presentation focuses specifically on recursive photography and
              mobile fieldwork conducted over the last 15 years throughout the
              American Southwest as part of an ongoing study of road trauma
              shrines, those vernacular roadside memorial assemblages built by
              private individuals at sites where family or friends have died in
              automotive accidents.</p>  
              <p>Road trauma shrines represent absent bodies while being things
              themselves, and they do so while doing something while being
              embedded in everyday landscapes literally zooming with convergent
              and divergent activities.  Each shrine replaces the interrupted
              life of the victim with a proxy virtual life that is allowed to
              take its course as the victim’s life was expected to before being
              interrupted by the crash.  As such, shrines not only literally
              re-place the victim in social space, but also compensate for the
              dis-placed victim’s lost future as a social entity while also
              serving as the location for the ongoing “working-through” of
              trauma for those left behind.  And especially when shrines change
              and decay over time, that first transference of body to object is
              further materialized in the form of melancholy remains, revealing
              that the shrine as proxy memory/space is not only living, but also
              dying—all over again, there on the roadside, in front of the
              motoring public.</p>
              <p>Because roadside shrines communicate in ways that are not only
              more than linguistic, but also more than visual, more than
              material, and more than spatial (and thus
              visual/material/spatial), they constitute a rich site for
              exploring the communicative dimensions of visual, material, and
              spatial culture--particularly in this presentation, which also is
              performed through the tension between writing and
              image-making.</p>

              teaches courses in critical media studies, visual communication,
              memory studies, and the cultures of automobility.  His work as an
              analyst, photographer, and theorist of visual culture, material
              culture, and spatial culture focuses on the ways that
              extra-linguistic phenomena such as objects, pictures, and spaces

              things.  He is particularly interested in the affective and
