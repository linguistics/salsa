            <em><strong>Creating Community: Feasting and Chanting among the Nantis 
            of Peruvian Amazonia</strong></em> <br>
            <br>
            This paper discusses novel verbal performances that have emerged in 
            the Nanti community of Montetoni in Peruvian Amazonia. This community 
            began holding village-wide feasts in 1997; today they feast at roughly 
            one-week intervals. During this 24-hour event, villagers form groups 
            in the communal spaces of the village to chant together while drinking 
            <i>oburoxi </i>(a yuca beer). Individual chanters interpolate improvised 
            lines, or xarintaa, between short formulae chanted by the group. <i>Xarintaa</i> 
            is complex, provocative, and highly creative in both form and content. 
            I will discuss the novel sociocultural circumstances that accompanied 
            the emergence of feasting practices and provide examples of chant 
            formulae and <i>xarintaa</i>. </font></p>

          <em><strong>Dude, What Was I Talking About? A New Sociolinguistic Framework 
          for Marijuana-Intoxicated Speech </strong></em></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
          effects of intoxication on speech is an under-researched field. Of the 
          research that has been done, most works are concerned with mechanical 
          errors in speech production, and then only intoxication by beer/liquor 
          is considered. This work is to be a two-fold project creating a sociolinguistic 
          framework for the effects of marijuana intoxication on the communicative 
          aspects of speech. The first part, presented here, concerns fitting 
          the peculiarities of marijuana-intoxicated speech into a framework for 
          conversation analysis. Namely, that marijuana-intoxicated speech more 
          readily reflects the communication rules for meetings than for regular 
          conversation. This paper, then, is the inter-personal aspect of marijuana-intoxicated 
          (stoned) speech.</font></p>

          <strong><em>The Role of Language in Ideological Construction of Mayan 
          Identities in Guatemala</em></strong></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
          paper examines the ways in which Mayan identities are ideologically 
          constructed through language practices. It explores language ideologies 
          based on the analysis of metalinguistic commentaries and code switching 
          incidents gathered in Momostenango, a K'iche' Maya town in Guatemala. 
          Employing Gal and Irvine (1995, 2000)'s semiotic notions, this study 
          shows that K'iche' Mayan language serves as an icon that portrays and 
          as an index that marks Mayan identities. I argue that social categories 
          are not only associated with certain forms of speech, but also constructed 
          based on typification of certain forms of speech onto which ethnoracial 
          stratification is projected.</font></p>

            <em><strong>Maya Linguists, Linguistics, and the Politics of Identity</strong></em></font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mayas 
            are engaged in a cultural revitalization movement which seeks to both 
            reaffirm cultural values and open political space which has been closed 
            to them since the arrival of the Spanish. Language has taken a central 
            position in the definition of Maya identity and in the demands, both 
            implicit and explicit, for Maya cultural and political autonomy. Mayas 
            who are linguists play an active role in the Maya movement, from technical 
            and political perspectives. This paper examines the contributions 
            made by Maya linguists in three areas: 1) to the Maya movement, where 
            the nature of the interaction is largely political, 2) to the modification 
            of language ideologies, which involves analysis and reaction to ideas 
            about language that have been generated both internally and externally; 
            and 3) to linguistics, where Mayas have both benefited from and formulated 
            a critique of the contributions of academic linguistics.</font></p>

          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
            study investigates the language ideologies and practices underlying 
            a dialect revival occurring in a multilingual community in the Italian 
            Alps. Focusing on caretaker-child interactions it highlights the role 
            of overt and covert language ideologies and practices in sustaining 
            the resurgence of the local language after years of convergence towards 
            the national standard. In addition to explicit ideologies supporting 
            the local code as marker of a rediscovered cultural heritage and local 
            identity and the promotion of biligualism as a cognitive advantage, 
            specific code-switching, code-mixing and "Prestigious Practices" contribute 
            to the resurgence of the local language supporting its vitality and 
            transmission. </font></p>

              <strong><em>The Maya Movement and Modernity: Local Kaqchikel Linguistic 
              Ideologies and the Problem of Progress</em></strong></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I investigate 
              the language ideologies of bilingual urban Maya-Kaqchikels from 
              Chimaltenango to assess: 1) to what extent their language shift 
              from Kaqchikel to Spanish is a rejection of collective Maya identity 
              and 2) what advances Pan-Mayas have made among Maya citizens in 
              revalorizing the ideological connection between language and collective 
              Maya identity. I argue that the discourse of progress, made up of 
              the "traditional past" ideologically linked with Kaqchikel and, 
              the "modern present" ideologically linked with Spanish, are the 
              most salient language ideologies fueling language shift in the area. 
              Even as ordinary Maya-Kaqchikels construct the discourse of progress, 
              they also articulate a supplementary discourse about Mayan languages 
              that links Kaqchikel with Maya ancestors in the "traditional past" 
              and with Maya culture in the "modern" present. It is this reconfiguration 
              of the discourse of progress that shows the effects of Pan-Maya 
              activists and scholars on language revitalization.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> This 
              paper connects the work linguistic anthropology with recent labor 
              studies scholarship that examines union organizing. Focussing on 
              the one-to-one interactions between union organizers and workers, 
              what I label "organizing moments," I assert that language use and 
              communication skills are critical to accomplishing the union goal 
              of garnering support from workers and achieving discrete political 
              and economic goals. This paper studies the membership drives of 
              two unions through ethnographic observation, interviews and discourse 
              analysis. This paper examines the interrelationship between the 
              language ideologies of union organizers, workers, and management, 
              and how these ideologies inform organizing moments and determine 
              their efficacy.</font></p>

              This study assumes a discursive process in the development of significant 
              linguistic parallels. The assumption of discourse in the production 
              of grammatical meaning links this discussion significantly to issues 
              in linguistic ideology. This paper will consider how the discursive 
              production of meaning by reference to salient imagery relates to 
              the discursive production of legitimacy within speaking communities.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Using 
              examples from the music of Prince Buster, this essay will demonstrate 
              the role played by the use of vernacular language registers in the 
              establishment of a body of political commentary within the lyrical 
              content of Jamaican popular music in the mid- to late 1960s. Predating 
              both the emergence of explicitly Rastafarian content and the use 
              of "Dread Talk" in song lyrics, these commentaries relied on the 
              creative manipulation of a variety of language registers. In the 
              work of Prince Buster in particular, manipulations of language and 
              representations of speakers were central to the creation of a simultaneous 
              critique of urban crime, political violence and the persistence 
              of colonial forms of authority in newly independent Jamaica.</font></p>

              paper examines an ethnographic example of the semiotic process identified 
              by Irvine & Gal (2000) as fractal recursivity. Examples of recursivity 
              in Mexicano and Spanish are analyzed, showing how users of these

              of language, identity and progress through talk, as they define 
              themselves in relation to others. A focus on the linguistic ways

              <strong><em>Reformulating the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis: Discourse, 
              Interaction, and Distributed Cognition</em></strong></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
              paper considers a reformulation of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis in 
              terms of socially-distributed cognition and discourse. In this reformulation, 
              the impact of language on cognition is seen as operating via the 
              effect of discursive practices on communicative interaction, which 
              directly shapes distributed cognitive processes that emerge in groups 
              of interacting individuals. <br>
              <br>
              I support this reformulation with evidence from case studies of 
              students working to solve physics problems collaboratively. I show 
              that the frequency with which individuals communicate with each 
              another (an aspect of discursive practice) affects how different 
              groups explore solutions to their problems (an aspect of group-level 
              cognitive activity).</font></p>

              Present Cultural Values</strong></em> <strong><br>
              </strong><br>
              Within a discourse-centered approach to language and culture, recordings 
              of cultural legends are specific occurrences of discourse that are 
              linked to the past through other tellings of the same and related 
              legends, but are also elements in the ongoing discursive process 
              of the definition of cultural values. I investigate strategies used 
              within a series of Tohono O'odham legends to present moral judgements 
              and values, following the work of Labov, Bakhtin, Hill and Zepeda, 
              identifying different affective stances the storyteller assumes 
              with regards to the events being reported, and focusing on recurrent 
              themes that shape the version of cultural values presented. </font></p>

              <em><strong>Practices for Delicately Seeking Information: What are 
              the Alternatives? </strong></em> <strong><br>
              </strong><br>
              Participants in interaction have ways of seeking information such 
              that the activity appears to be something other than seeking information. 
              One type of occasion in which participants seek information without 
              going on record is when they anticipate that the co-participant 
              might make unwanted inferences had they asked directly. In using 
              off-the-record information seeking strategies, participants attempt 
              to avoid the negative inferences that their co-participants possibly 
              might have made. <br>
              <br>
              In situations in which a participant uses an information seeking 
              strategy that seems designed to lessen the threat of the co-participant's 
              making unwanted inferences, those strategies are not necessarily 
              successful. What happens when an initial off-the-record information 
              seeking attempt is not successful? One option for the participant 
              is to employ a different information seeking method or format. If 
              the participant employs an on-the-record information seeking method 
              or format, he or she may incorporate different methods to deal with 
              concerns about negative inferences. <br>
              <br>
              Prof. Pomerantz will discuss two case studies. The first case involves 
              a patient who wanted to find out his blood pressure reading during 
              the medical consultation. His initial attempt was formatted as a 
              clarification of the doctor's report; his subsequent attempt was 
              an on-the-record inquiry with an accompanying account for asking. 
              The second case concerns a friend who attempted to seek information 
              from a friend about her activities on the previous evening. Her 
              initial attempt was a my side telling; the subsequent attempt was 
              an on-the record inquiry. Prof. Pomerantz will conclude the talk 
              with comments on the analytic concept of 'alternatives.' </font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Computer 
              gaming is often considered a predominantly male domain. Thornborrow 
              (1998) indicates that, in order to participate in the discourse 
              of computer gaming, women must adopt a male-centered discourse. 
              However, the discourse of females and males playing two online games 
              indicates that gender-based differences are diminished in this environment, 
              suggesting that the discourse of the online gaming community is 
              less influenced by gender-based expectations, and that gamers, both 
              male and female, utilize a less-blatantly gendered discourse. This 
              study includes a gender-based analysis of the use of characteristics 
              such as emoticons, war metaphors, inclusive and exclusive pronouns, 
              gender references, and screen names.</font></p>

              speech" in Huehuetla Tepehua (HT), a Totonacan language, is a manner 
              of speaking that is used when the speaker feels great affection 
              for or is much older than the addressee and that is accomplished 
              by the shifting of certain consonant phonemes. Affectionate speech 
              is also a useful tool in the reconstruction of two lost HT phonemes, 
              the plain and glottalized uvular stops. In this presentation, I 
              explain the production and utilization of affectionate speech, examine 
              the ability of HT speakers of various ages to produce it, and discuss 
              the effectiveness of using it for reconstructive work.</font></p>

                  The analysis presents evidence that variation is also correlated
