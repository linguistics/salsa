          paper examines discourses of language purism in Juchitn, Oaxaca, Mexico, 
          taking number terms as a case in point. Isthmus Zapotec has retained 
          pre-Hispanic terms for cardinal numbers one through ten, twenty, and 
          multiples of one hundred; other terms in general use are borrowed from 
          Spanish. Purist consciousness increasingly problematizes the use of 
          many Spanish-origin terms, including numbers, in certain contexts. I 
          compare the present-day and pre-Hispanic systems, and emerging purist 
          practices in local radio programming and everyday conversations, and 
          how they show the inevitable tensions involved in forging contemporary, 
          authentic ways of counting in Zapotec. </font>

          paper examines the practice of "political linguistics" (technical linguistic 
          research with self-consciously political ends) among Kaqchikel Maya 
          linguists. Presenting data on the creation of neologisms, we argue that 
          the practice of Kaqchikel political linguistics is conditioned by the 
          social relationship between professional native linguists and other 
          native speakers, the explicitly political and often confrontational 
          relationship between native linguists and the Guatemalan state, and 
          the structural position of Guatemala and Maya scholar-activists within 
          the global political economy. We argue that the dynamic interplay of 
          structural relations act to shape not only indigenous linguistic research 
          but Maya worldview as well. </font>

          paper explores how historical shift in the system of pronominal address 
          of Silesian, a dialect of Polish, may be seen as guided by the cultural 
          ideology of its speakers. Silesians, over the course of this century, 
          have experienced the transfer of their territory from Germany to Poland, 
          and this transfer has occasioned the replacement of one element of the 
          pronominal address system, a calque from German, with a loan from Polish. 
          The paper argues for cultural ideology as a force guiding this shift 
          and examines continuity and change within it. </font>

          both conceptually and syntactically. Rather than being created through 
          the residential mix of the community, then, diversity is brought into 
          the community by immigrants. Through focusing on constructed actions 
          of immigrants, then, diversity talk comes to be not about how diversity 
          affects the whole community, but rather how it affects non-immigrants, 
          in either positive or negative ways. </font>

          forms of talk. Participant-observation and interviews with middle-class 
          adult residents of Tucson, Arizona, reveal significant constraints &shy; 
          temporal, spatial, and socioeconomic &shy; that impinge on what conversation 
          analysts call "talk for the sake of talking." For example, speakers 
          often refer to casual conversation as incidental to other activities, 
          such as coffee-drinking, rather than a distinct activity in its own 
          right. Moreover, nonkin and non-cohabiting speakers often choose to 
          converse in commercial spaces, such as bars, restaurants and coffeehouses.

          textile mill town in Georgia is the site of recent linguistic change. 
          Due in large part to the rise of new industry around the turn of the 
          century, dialects formerly traceable to original settlement patterns 
          were quickly altered with the influx of mill workers from northern Georgia 
          and Alabama and the creation of enclosed mill villages. This study incorporates 
          current original field work with the findings of dialectologists and 
          sociolinguists working in the southeast. Patterns of linguistic variation 
          are investigated according to a social network study which finds significance

          age, race, and gender. </font>

          This paper reports the language shift from Southern Min toward Mandarin

          question "How does the language shift from Southern Min toward Mandarin

          been documented, for example Huang (1988), Yeh (1989), Young (1989)

          Taiwan from a different angle from most of the previous studies. </font>

          studies have demonstrated the importance of recognizing the link between 
          language and identity. Haitians experience conflict in establishing 
          their identities due to the stigma associated with speaking Creole. 
          In this study, I examine the effects of Creole, French, and English 
          on the creation of the identities of Haitian immigrants attending a 
          New Jersey university. The basis for this study is ethnographic in that 
          it is based on interviews and tapes of conversations between these students. 
          Their sense of identity is reflected by their attitudes towards the 
          three languages and their choice of which language to use in various 
          situations. </font>

          this paper I discuss the inter-relation of grammar and culture by examining 
          the use of deixis in the narratives of gangsta rap. By analyzing the 
          use of grammatical items which locate individuals spatially and temporally, 
          I will argue that the evocation of pre-existing cognitive cultural models 
          in this discourse also locates individuals culturally and ideologically. 
          This approach seeks to integrate cognitive linguistics with anthropological 
          approaches to language: namely, the political economy and ideology of 
          verbal art. </font>

          performances in Liège, Belgium are rich documents of metalinguistic 
          activity. Prosody, phonology, syntax, lexicon and discourse structure 
          are all manipulated to create enjoyable stories which resonate with 
          people¹s lived experiences. Lived experience for Belgians includes frequent 
          political discussion of language use. Rather than the aspects of language 
          listed above, political discussion focuses on the choice of code which 
          has been a major political problem in multilingual Belgium for over 
          a hundred years. Puppeteers frequently allude to national language politics 
          during their performances. This paper examines the nature of such allusions.

          while it poses very specific tasks for its practitioners, it also reflects 
          and represents phenomena that are characteristic of all spontaneous, 
          "oral" uses of language. We present a preliminary exploration of failures 
          and repair in freestyle rapping, in situations where M.C.¹s battle one

          work on the nature of cross-linguistic interpretation has focused on 
          the dual nature of interpretation, as both the point of contact between 
          linguistic codes and also between cultural and cognitive domains (Berk-Seligson 
          1990, Calzada Perez 1993, Juhel 1983). Analyses of the interpretive 
          work done in Bible translations (Kugel 1997, Rafael 1993) point out 
          the importance of recognizing "translation" as a form of cultural negotiation 
          and dissemination; the interpretation of the words and of "The Word" 
          march hand in hand. In this paper I give an account of cross-linguistic 
          medical interpretation that stresses the dual nature of medical interpreting: 
          on the one hand medical interpreters are urged to perform with absolute 
          semantic fidelity; on the other they are required to negotiate the interpretive 
          patterns of dialogue in medical interviews so that the collaborative 
          processes of diagnosis may be achieved. In short, medical interpreters 
          are engaged in the interpretation of interpretation.</font><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>

          paper is a critical analysis of a joint declaration of the Parliaments 
          of Russia, Byelorussia, Latvia, and the Ukraine opposing an eastward 
          expansion of the NATO block. The study shows that the use of the "anti-NATO" 
          theme could be a major asset in the build-up of political identity in 
          countries of the former USSR. Accordingly, it is demonstrated that the 
          deputies' declaration is in fact an enactment of political power on 
          the home front, exercised within a pragmatic frame ensuring credibility 
          and acceptance of messages. The principal components of this frame include 
          a (quasi)realistic assessment, simplicity of expression, and moderate 
          idealism. All three contribute to the perception of responsibility on 
          the part of the leader. A successful enforcement of the concept of responsibility 
          is thus crucial to the successful enactment of leadership and power. 
          The analysis of indicators of power and responsibility in the text bridges 
          considerations of pragmatic, sociolinguistic, and psychological nature. 
          The major questions addressed are the use of assertion and repeated 
          exposure, construction of argument and fear appeals, organization of 
          text and sentence arrangement, and the role of intended vagueness. </font>

          on knowledge and being a model for people to follow, and in the hierarchical 
          teacher-student relationship, the English text illustrates the sociocultural

          paper examines the production of kirata, a form of verbal art practiced

          folk etymology has been applied to kirata and related practices in Javanese 
          and Balinese, I suggest that this phenomenon might be more fruitfully 
          characterized as a type of performed ethnolexicology so as to highlight 
          its characteristics as a method of lexical recomposition. In the Western 
          linguistic tradition such practices have been associated with etymologizing, 
          but the example of kirata calls into question whether such recomposition 
          must be ë(folk-)etymologically construed. When viewed in cultural context, 
          the practice of kirata emerges as a crucial mechanism for Sundanese 
          text-building and reveals metapragmatic norms by which language may 
          be strategically reshaped to social ends. </font>

          of apprehension of past events (i.e. narrative and reverie) into dialogue. 
          By presenting a working-class masculine mexicano self grounded in a 
          family tradition of performance, he responds creatively to social tensions

          one is tied not only to the tradition of the people, but to a geographical
