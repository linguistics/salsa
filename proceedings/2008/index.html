          <strong>"Basic Information Structure" and "Academic Language": An Approach to 
            Discourse Analysis</strong> <br>
            <br>
            This paper has two purposes. One purpose is to introduce a tool for 
            analyzing some aspects of discourse. This tool is based on what I will 
            call "Basic Information Structure" ("BIS" for short). The second purpose 
            is to apply this tool to a specific example so that I can both make 
            the use of the tool clear and speak to an issue I wish to address. The 
            issue is "academic language". Academic language is a general name for 
            many different varieties of language associated with academic disciplines 
            or with academic content in schools, for example, the styles of language 
            and other symbol systems associated with chemistry or social science. 
            Some people have argued that academic varieties of language are functional 
            in the sense that they have evolved in history to do certain intellectual 
            and interactional tasks necessary for an academic domain to make progress. 
            They cannot simply be replaced with less specialized versions of language, 
            any more than a tool purpose-built for a specific job can simply be 
            replaced, without loss, by a more generalized tool. Others have argued 
            that such academic varieties of language are forms of "jargon" and complexity 
            invented to exclude, confuse, and frustrate outsiders (non-academics 
            and people outside a given field) and to hide or evade political, cultural, 
            institutional, and social issues in the name of "reason" or "logic". 
            This issue-whether academic varieties of language are functional or 
            ideological (in the informal senses I have given these terms here)-has 
            played a role in education. Some educators argue that children need 
            to be introduced in school (for example, in science classrooms) to academic 
            varieties of language early on, because mastery of these representational 
            systems is crucial for true understanding and real participation in 
            areas of science, for instance. Others have argued that academic varieties 
            of language simply serve to make the "rich" kids look smarter than the 
            "poor" ones-because they have had more home-based preparation for such 
            varieties. Such academic varieties of language are barriers to understanding 
            and participation, on this view, and need to be replaced with more democratic 
            forms of language, interaction, and participation. I want to use one 
        approach to discourse analysis to investigate these divides.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">New 
          communication technologies are providing us not just with a new context 
          for our conventional ways of doing things, but are creating new spaces 
          and boundaries for participation. At the interactional level, human 
          actions are highly influenced by shared repertoires learned over a lifetime 
          but people also show a surprisingly fast adaptability to new tools and 
          conditions and new forms and spaces of human-machine collaboration. 
          This talk will discuss some current research into ways that communication 
          technologies are impacting interaction, such as how participants are 
          managing multiple participation spaces through technology, and new forms 
          of sociality. Data will be discussed from current research on societal 
          impacts of mobile phone technology, digital gaming contexts, visualizations 
          of new processes in engineered medicine, and interactions using web 
        cameras and personal computers. </font></p>

            Practice</strong> <font size="1">(<a href="Martinez_2008.pdf">paper</a>) </font> </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
          present work provides an argument for and illustration of how to study 
          lived-experiences of sexuality in a classroom or academic setting. It 
          makes an argument for a specific development of queer and feminist theory 
          related to sexuality. It presents a theoretical argument in favor of 
          communicological approach to the study of sexuality, and illustrates 
          the cogency of this approach with feminist and queer theories. Semiotic 
          phenomenology (the methodological approach in communicology) is presented 
          as an appropriate research practice from which to study sexuality. Three 
          major concerns are addressed: the meaningfulness of sexuality as the 
          subject matter of study; the body and the immediacy of lived experience 
          as the site of study; and the relationship between speech, culture, 
          and linguistic representation in the research process. The work of Maurice 
          Merleau-Ponty provides the theoretical and applied foundation of the 
          present work.</font></p>

          contact and acquisition: learning a new mixed language and Warlpiri</font></strong></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A 
          new mixed language, Light Warlpiri, has emerged in a remote community 
          in northern Australia. It is spoken by children and young adults in 
          the multilingual community of Lajamanu and has developed within the 
          last 30 years. Most verbs and the verbal morphology are from Aboriginal 
          English or Kriol (AE/Kriol), while most nominal morphology is from Lajamanu 
          Warlpiri (the variety of Warlpiri spoken in Lajamanu community). Nouns 
          are drawn from both types of source language. An innovative auxiliary 
          system has developed which draws on, but is not the same as, the systems 
          in the source languages. But the system for indicating grammatical functions 
          draws directly on the two typologically different source languages. 
          Lajamanu Warlpiri uses case-marking in an ergative-absolutive system 
          while AE/Kriol uses word order (SVO) in a nominative-accusative system. 
          In Light Warlpiri these two systems meet.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
          language ecology in the community is complex, and code-switching between 
          languages is very common. Children growing up in the community learn 
          the new language, Light Warlpiri, as their primary language, and also 
          learn Lajamanu Warlpiri in their early years. Their learning situation 
          raises the question of how they deal with very mixed input - to what 
          extent do they show adult-like variation and patterning in the grammatical 
          systems of each language? The study uses production and comprehension 
          data to examine the children's use of word order and ergative case-marking 
          in each language.</font></p>

          <strong>Complex indexicality of Urdu in India</strong><br>
  <br>
          There is an implicit assumption in sociolinguistic research using the 
          concept of indexicality that at a given time, one linguistic element 
          indexes one single social category. In this paper, I argue that linguistic 
          units often exhibit multiple layers of indexicality. Analyzing language 
          ideologies of Urdu and Hindi speakers of Delhi, I demonstrate that Urdu 
          represents a palimpsest of indexicality. To the first generation of 
          Muslims and Hindus born before the Partition of India in 1947, Urdu 
          indexes education and cultural refinement. To the second generation 
          of Muslims and Hindus born after 1947, however, Urdu indexes an exclusive 
          Muslim identity. To the third generation of Muslims of Delhi, Urdu indexes 
          a poor, uneducated, and conservative Muslim identity. Theoretically, 
          I draw upon frameworks from the disciplines of sociolinguistics and 
          linguistic anthropology. Methodologically, this research combines in-depth 
          ethnographic observations with a quantitative analysis of the distribution 
          of the Urdu phonemes across three generations.</font></p>

              <strong>&quot;It&#146;s not very funny&#148;: Heightened performance through 
          prefaces of formulaic jokes in interaction</strong> <br>
          <br>
          Previous studies of the role of prefaces in formulaic jokes conclude 
          that the basic function of such prefaces is to allow the teller to distance 
          himself or herself from the joke&#146;s content in case it fails. However, 
          this body of research has two limitations. First, the emphasis on joke 
          content overlooks the important role of performance in joke telling. 
          Second, the use of recorded interactional data has been limited in such 
          scholarship. In this paper, I address both of these shortcomings in 
          some previous research by using interactional data to show that prefaces 
          are used to manage not only the content but also the performance-related 
          risk of formulaic jokes. Furthermore, I show that while the use of a 
          risk-related preface may serve to mitigate risk and/or disaffiliate 
          the teller from the joke, in many cases it can also serve to heighten 
          the performance.</font>        </div>

          <strong>Temporal cues: What children with severe autism can teach us about the 
          organization of intersubjectivity</strong><br>
            <br>
          This paper examines the achievement of a joint temporal orientation 
          in interactions involving a child with severe autism. Based on video 
          recordings of naturally occurring interactions between children with 
          severe autism and their RPM teachers/assistants, this paper highlights 
          patterns through which the children and adults attend to each other 
          and the process of creating meaning in the dynamic unfolding of an RPM-mediated 
          interaction. Drawing from linguistic anthropology, conversation analysis, 
          and phenomenology, it is argued that temporal synchronization is foundational 
          to the development of intersubjectivity on a pre-symbolic level. Specifically, 
          this paper explores ways in which interlocutors use their bodies, objects, 
          and pitch to indicate their attention to different segments of an action 
          sequence, thereby lessening their interlocutor&#146;s need for prior 
          knowledge of an event and allowing for attunement in novel situations. 
          Individuals&#146; modification of the physical environment can function 
        as temporal cues, facilitating the coordinated advance of joint attention.</font></p>

          <strong>Evidence for language-mediated thought in the perception of non-gendered 
          figures</strong> <br>
            <br>
          Recently, researchers have begun applying experimental methodologies 
          in the investigation of language-mediated thought in domains such as 
          mathematics (cf. Gordon 2004) and spatial topology (cf. Levinson and 
          Wilkins 2006). This study presents evidence for language-mediated thought 
          in a more socially-oriented domain. A series of short discrimination 
          tasks, involving diagrams of non-gendered figures, were undertaken with 
          speakers of an Amazonian language lacking grammatical gender. The same 
          tasks were also undertaken with speakers of languages with grammatical 
          gender in their pronoun paradigms, namely English and Portuguese. Significant 
          differences between the two populations were obtained for the tasks 
          described, demonstrating that Karitiana speakers were much less likely 
          to perceive non-gendered figures to be male, when contrasted to the 
          Portuguese and English speakers. The motivation for the disparity between 
          groups appears to be the non-prompted default utilization of male pronouns 
          by the majority of Portuguese and English respondents, during the course 
          of the tasks.</font></p>

          <strong>The postcolonial dialogue in Talpense men's talk<br>
          </strong><br>
          Religious practices have significant impacts on residents&#146; ideologies 
          of personhood in Talpa de Allende, Jalisco, Mexico (Keane 1997). People&#146;s 
          experiences of religious and economic practice in rural Mexico affect 
          their discursive practices. The ways that Talpenses talk about the Church 
          have implications about their social identities. Residents&#146; orthodox, 
          neutral, and critical stances toward the practices of Church personnel 
          manifest in their everyday conversations. Much to the public dismay 
          of Talpense women (who generally engage in an orthodox discourse supportive 
          of Church personnel and practice,) many Talpense men engage in a postcolonial 
          discourse that critically frames their relationship toward the Church. 
          Disturbingly, men&#146;s engagement in this postcolonial evaluation 
          of the Church inextricably links them to another discursive forum&not; 
          (usually in the course of one speech event) where they give voice to 
          their marginalized experiences in light of contemporary Mexican economic 
          and government contexts.</font></p>

          <strong>LOL, what a tangled Web we weave: Strategies for coherence in instant 
          messaging discourse</strong></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Instant 
          messaging (IM) has unique linguistic properties and norms due to the 
          limitations of the medium and users&#146; needs. Specifically, Herring 
          (1999) identifies &#147;interactional incoherence&#148;, which involves 
          the &#147;fragmented, agrammatical, and interactionally disjointed&#148; 
          nature of IM. This incoherence is characterized by overlap of adjacent 
          exchanges and the simultaneous existence of multiple topics in chat 
          discourse. I propose that IM users have specific strategies for maintaining 
          comprehensibility, and examine two factors affecting these strategies: 
          IM experience and interpersonal familiarity. To discover the properties 
          of conversational organization in IM, I use an adapted Conversation 
          Analysis methodology and posit the &#145;contribution&#146; as the basic 
          unit of IM conversation. I analyze ten short conversations, finding 
          that overlap occurs equally in novice and advanced users&#146; conversations. 
          Advanced users, however, maintain comprehensibility by using shorter 
          contributions, discourse markers, and special characters. Shared background 
          knowledge between conversants also plays a large role.</font></p>

          <strong>The Impact of bilingual education on indigenous language and culture: 
          The case of Tapirape</strong><br>
            <br>
          Bilingual schools are recognized as an important resource for increasing 
          the chances of language survival, but in many cases have shown to be 
          ineffective. Among the Tapirape (central Brazil), an effective bilingual 
          school exists; however, this study shows that even a successful school 
          brings complications for the community. Participant observation and 
          audio-recorded interviews, in which teachers and leaders discuss their 
          bilingual school and its consequences for the Tapirape people, reveal 
          that Tapirape teachers and leaders feel that the school has changed 
          the Tapirape lifestyle in both negative and positive ways. A continuous 
          evaluation and on-going reconstruction of aspects of the school, through 
          consultation with the community, is proposed as a way to both attend 
          to the needs and to relieve the worries of groups like the Tapirape 
          with respect to the impact of their school on the community.</font></p>

          perspective</strong></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This 
          paper discusses some aspects of intercultural communication in an academic 
          setting reflecting the linguistic and cultural differences between Russian 
          and American speakers of English. It examines cultural variation in 
          classroom discourse and the role of verbal and non-verbal patterns in 
          teacher-student communication.<br>
            <br>
          Russian professors teaching in the US colleges encounter numerous intercultural 
          distinctions in communication, from different terms of address and lack 
          of the tu/vous distinction to dissimilar ways of expressing requests, 
          asking questions, and wording negative answers. The &#145;directness&#146; 
          of Russian is sometimes interpreted as &#145;rudeness&#146; by American 
          students, while the American tendency to use understatements impresses 
          Russian professors as &#145;vagueness&#146;, &#145;ambiguity&#146;, 
          and lack of accuracy. Avoiding extreme statements or absolute claims 
          is natural for American students, but alien to East European professors. 
          I discuss the intercultural differences in applying politeness/directness 
          discourse strategies drawing on the observation of class discussions 
          and the analysis of the surveys filled out by students.</font></p>

          <strong>Genre change, language change? Forms of plural address in email hoaxes 
          and other genres</strong></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">While 
          the Internet is a vibrant site of genre emergence and change, it remains 
          disputed whether this macro-change plays a role in actual linguistic 
          micro-change. This paper argues for a more subtle role of CMC genres: 
          due to their intermediate spoken/written status, they can act as catalysts 
          for ongoing processes of linguistic change and provide a first &#147;point 
          of entry&#148; into the written domain for previously oral forms.<br>
            <br>
          This hypothesis is tested against a corpus of 150 email hoaxes (EHs): 
          deceptive messages that spread in digital social networks and are a 
          form of 1-to-n communication which fosters open plurality. The morphosyntactic 
          variable under investigation is the emergence of 2nd person plural forms 
          such as 'you guys' that strive to fill the gap in the English pronoun 
          paradigm. The occurrence of such forms in the EH corpus is analyzed: 
          what is their function within the genre? How may the technicality of 
          the medium ultimately support the process of linguistic change? As an 
          outlook, comparative data from digital and traditional genres are discussed.</font></p>

          <strong>Teaching stories: Cultural and educational uses of traditional and personal 
          narrative in the Choctaw language classroom</strong></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Stories, 
          traditional indigenous forms for cultural and linguistic transmission, 
          provide comprehensible language input as described by Krashen (1985), 
          enable scaffolding (Vygotsky 1986), and reduce learner affect (Cantoni 
          1999). Native language instructors may also use stories to provide relevant 
          texts, to recreate Native identity, and to transmit sociolinguistic 
          knowledge. This paper relates one Choctaw language instructor&#146;s 
          narrative use in the classroom.<br>
            <br>
          Choctaw linguistic knowledge, such as vocabulary and sentence construction, 
          is intimately tied to sociolinguistic practices, such as eye-contact 
          avoidance and salutation and departure customs. The instructor uses 
          cultural, traditional, and personal stories in a fluid, interwoven narrative 
          style to support cultural instruction, community identity construction, 
          and language and sociolinguistic practice integration, mirroring the 
          traditional Choctaw narrative style (Mould 2003). While not reflecting 
          the methods advocated in SLA, this grounding of traditional and personal 
          stories in instructional narrative, meta-narration, and linguistic example, 
        appears particularly appropriate to teaching Choctaw language and culture. </font></p>

          <strong>Vowels in contact: Mexican Heritage English in Chicago</strong><br>
  <br>
          Recent research on the dialect of English spoken in Hispanic communities 
          in the U.S. has acknowledged the importance of distinguishing between 
          the dialectal form and the accented English spoken by second language 
          learners. However, empirical analysis of the differences is limited. 
          The current study characterizes the vowel space of native speakers of 
          Mexican heritage English (MHE) in the Albany Park community of Chicago. 
          The stable vowel system of these speakers is contrasted with the more 
          variable system of Mexican late learners of English (L2E). Further, 
          MHE vowels are compared to those of the Chicago matrix dialect. Analysis 
          of the three varieties demonstrates that the vowel system of MHE, while 
          influenced by a Spanish language context, is distinct from that of L2E, 
          but also distinct from the system of the Chicago matrix dialect. Chicago 
          MHE is then compared to similar communities in other U.S. regions, focusing 
          on similarities that demonstrate the influence of Spanish.</font></p>

          the &#145;Familiar Exotic&#146; in second language learner discourse</strong><br>
            <br>
          This study recounts an interaction between three second language learners 
        of Japanese who were given the task of constructing a &#145;Japan booth&#146; 
          to represent Japan to an audience of American undergraduates at a hypothetical 
          international festival. Qualitative analysis informed by van Dijk&#146;s 
          ideological analysis identifies the interlocutors&#146; co-construction 
          of what can be termed, the familiar exotic. In other words, the product 
          that emerges from this interaction displays symbols chosen for their 
          imagined familiarity to an American audience as the exotic Japanese 
          &#145;other&#146;. It is argued that, from their trans-national stance 
          both between and across national borders, second language learners are 
          able to manipulate two otherwise distinct national ideologies in order 
          to construct familiar exotic imagery. The notion of the familiar exotic 
          may contribute to ongoing research into the process of re-negotiating&#145;self&#146;

          <strong>Hebrew GaySpeak: Subverting a gender-based language</strong><br>
  <br>
          Does language allow gender diversity? Research on gender and discourse 
          tends to focus on differences between women and men, disregarding sexual 
          orientation. The current ethnographic research fills the gap by exploring 
          the discourse strategy of Israeli gay men. I focus on inverted appellation 
          &#150; the use of feminine references for male persons.<br>
            <br>
          Hebrew is an inherently embedded gender-based language. Every word forces 
          the speaker to reveal his or her gender. Every verb, noun and pronoun 
          is either male or female.<br>
            <br>
          The subjects of this research, Israeli gay men, bend the rules of Hebrew 
          grammar, blurring the differences between male and female: A male person 
          might refer to himself or to another male in the feminine reference. 
          The Hebrew GaySpeak serves as a means to articulate and construct identity. 
          Inverted appellation demonstrates the gay critique of the prevalent 
          heterosexual perception of gender in society. Similar to Judith Butler's 
          work on drag queen, GaySpeak strategy enables gay men to reexamine and 
          challenge existing gender categories and question their naturalness. 
          They do so by practicing &quot;linguistic drag.&quot;</font></p>

          <strong>Not for your average brain: the social meaning of metaphor in an underground 
          hiphop community</strong><br>
            <br>
          In our discussion of performance and interpretive practices in an underground 
          hiphop community, we draw on interview data with an MC (hiphop performer) 
          and founder of a Native underground &#147;crew&#148; from Farmington, 
          NM, to show that this MC&#146;s use of metaphor is a gatekeeping practice 
          that works to create and reinforce group boundaries, and determine the 
          conditions for group membership, in one hiphop community of practice 
          (Eckert &amp; McConnell-Ginet, 1992). The MC articulates metalinguistic 
          ideologies about the use of metaphor in hiphop which, he claims, contrast 
          with metalinguistic ideologies from his (Navajo) community of origin. 
          We analyze the MC&#146;s hiphop practice as a process of enregisterment 
          (Agha, 2003) through which he and his crew create an innovative, performative 
          speech variety that is intended only to be understood by fellow participants 
          in the hiphop underground. Our analysis opens up new possibilities for 
          a linguistic anthropological approach to understanding performance in 
        the context of hiphop-based communities of practice.</font></p>

          This paper analyzes public reactions to statements made by former Republican

          he equated with teaching &#147;the language of living in a ghetto&#148;. 
          Considering data from two internet forums, Digg.com and Youtube.com, 
          I explore multimodal constructions of language ideologies through the 
          use of three discourse strategies &#150; linguistic reference, constructed 
          dialogue, and metaphoric language. Incorporating major frameworks from 
          interactional sociolinguistics, perspectives on outgroup language use, 
          and recent work on discourse and identity, I discuss how these devices 
          can be brought together into a framework for analyzing language ideological 
          discourse, which highlights the different ways in which individuals 
          connect Self, Other, and Language in discourse &#150; namely, through 
          the processes of designation, embodiment, and imagination. This study 
          also illuminates the fact that despite the different discursive means 
          afforded by each forum, users index their beliefs about language in 
          similar ways across contexts and modes.</font></p>

          of Muslim women converts in Colorado</strong><br>
            <br>
          This paper analyzes how female American converts to Islam in the Muslim 
          Student Association at the University of Colorado at Boulder construct 
          their gender identity in discourse. Specifically, I look at how two 
          female converts narrate their post-conversion experiences and authenticate 
          their new identities as pious Muslim women. The data consists of narratives 
          collected in interviews and reveals that the pious identity of these 
          American converts to Islam is more complex than an apparent embracing 
          of &#145;traditional Islam&#146;: the narratives are the sites of negotiating 
          tensions between &#145;secularism&#146; and &#145;religion&#146; and 
          between &#145;modernity&#146; and &#145;tradition&#146;. The interview 
          enables the women to conquer negative stereotypes about them, and about 
          Islam in general, and to construct a shared Islamic and U.S. culture. 
          They use elements of an Islamic discourse, which is a religion that 
          is foreign and marginalized in the U.S. discourse of secularism, modernity, 
          and feminism, but they also construct the U.S. as an ideal place for 
        Muslim women because they can be who they want to be.</font></p>

          <strong>Osaka Aunties: Negotiating honorific language, gender, and regionality</strong><br>
  <br>
          Our understandings of Japanese women&#146;s speech practices have flourished 
          over the past thirty-plus years; however, the majority of this scholarship 
          has been focused on Standard Japanese speakers, regional women have 
          not enjoyed the same scrutiny. Various questions arise then about how 
          regional speakers use language at the everyday local level. Using empirical 
          data drawn from naturally occurring informal all-female conversations 
          among groups of Kansai women (ranging in age from thirty to seventy), 
          this paper aims to shed light on the speech practices of non-standard 
          speakers of Japanese. The dialect used in the Western (Kansai) part 
          of Japan is considered a prestige yet non-standard dialect. Honorific 
          verb morphology is the specific point of investigation. In particular, 
          the dialectal honorific form ~haru is examined. Preliminary results 
          indicate that this honorific form is preferred by dialect speakers to

          <strong>Spatialized authenticity in Hip Hop discourse</strong><br>
  <br>
          This paper examines Hip Hop music as a site for constructing the spatial 
          authenticity of linguistic, as well as social, practices. Specifically, 
          we argue that the repeated use of certain linguistic features in &quot;authenticating 
          discourse&quot; (Bucholtz 2003; Shenk 2007), whereby artists attempt 
          to emphasize their connection to place, indexically links the linguistic 
          with the local. To explore these processes, we discuss a case study 
          of phonetic variation against the backdrop of spatial authentication 
          in the Hip Hop music of Houston, Texas. Our analysis focuses on /I/-lowering 
          before engma, as the lowered variant is commonly implicated in lyrical 
          representations of the local. The phonetic data come from two Hip Hop 
          albums, produced by the same Houston artist, which differ markedly in 
          terms of local-orientedness. Our analysis shows that /I/-lowering occurs 
          with much greater frequency in the album where references to the local 
          are more frequent. We suggest that this pattern illustrates and provides 
          evidence for an ideology which construes /I/-lowering as locally-authentic 
        speech.</font></p>

          <strong>Doxastic modality as a means of stance taking in colloquial Sinhala</strong><br>
  <br>
          What has been traditionally studied as the involitive construction in 
          Colloquial Sinhala involves a verb form broadly indicative of non-volitionality 
          (Gair 1970, Inman 1993). However, Inman (1993) categorizes another usage 
          of the Sinhala involitive as doxastic (Kratzer 1981). Doxastic modality 
          indicates eventualities that occur counter to speaker expectations. 
          Previous explorations of stance in linguistics and anthropology have 
          examined a number of features including evidentials, discourse markers, 
          reported and indirect speech, indexicals, prosody, and affect. This 
          work adds to previous investigations of stance by describing an additional 
          means for evaluation and alignment in sets of recorded conversations 
          between young professionals in Sri Lanka. Moreover, contextualizing 
          stance taking methods in reference to both locally and culturally salient 
          expectations as well as interactionally specific participant roles (Bucholtz 
          and Hall 2005), I show how inquiries into!<br>
        stance reveal a speaker&#146;s emergent identity.</font></p>

          <strong>Family ideologies of lesbian and gay parents</strong><br>
  <br>
          In this talk I will discuss my analysis of semi-structured interviews 
          I conducted with lesbian and gay parents from a range of socioeconomic 
          and cultural backgrounds regarding the intersection of ideology and 
          family. In particular, I will focus on the discourses available to the 
          children in these families. Findings suggest that the parents draw linguistically 
          on a range of ideologies, from &#147;traditional&#148; definitions of 
          family (such as parents&#146; comparisons of their roles to heterosexual 
          norms) to those influenced by the feminist and gay rights movements 
          (such as equality, acceptance, and individuality). The ideologies affect 
          a variety of ongoing family practices such as story sharing at dinnertime, 
          religious practices, and the inclusion of extended family into their 
          daily lives. In addition to extending our knowledge of lesbian- and 
          gay-headed families, the work presented broadens our understanding in 
          general of the ways ideologies are used to create &#147;family&#148; 
        in the United States.</font></p>

          Borrowing and Code Switching in the Ancash Waynu Songs</strong><br>
          <br>
        </font><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
          the Andes, long-term contact between Quechua and Spanish speakers has 
          resulted in a variety of language contact outcomes in everyday speech 
          and other forms of language use. Ancash waynus, a genre of traditional 
          Andean songs, display different levels in which Quechua and Spanish 
          interact. This paper presents an analysis of the processes of borrowing 
          and code switching in Ancash waynus, showing the influence of Spanish 
          on this genre. Some waynus are composed &#145;purely&#146; in Quechua, 
          others &#145;purely&#146; in Spanish, and others in both languages. 
          All of them show different levels of mutual influence of Spanish on 
          Quechua and vice versa. Likewise, Ancash waynus often exhibit cases 
          of code switching which requires a mastery of Quechua and Spanish, and 
          it is affected by communicative intentions and poetic effects, and is 
          conditioned by social factors, such as interlocutors, topics, and formality. 
          I conclude that language change and bilingualism cover everyday speech 
        events and waynu songs.</font></p>

          <strong>Covert racist discourse on the WWW: Rhetorical strategies of the Minuteman 
          Project</strong></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The
          Minuteman Project (MMP) gained support from the American populace and 
          political elites through print and visual web texts that construct immigrants 
          from Mexico as an invading army of &#147;ILLEGAL aliens&#148; (MMP mission 
          statement). This research employs critical discourse analysis (Fairclough, 
          van Dijk) and (critical) metaphor theory (Lakoff, Santa Ana, Charteris-Black) 
          to illustrate how covert racist representations are widely dispersed 
          and circulated on the WWW. The specific focus of this presentation is 
          the MMP&#146;s use of rhetorical strategies such as metaphors and strategic 
          placement of disclaimers to maintain positive self-representation and 
          circumvent accusations of racism, at the same time as it appropriates 
          and subverts events and web images to create fearful depictions of the 
          &#147;mobs&#148; of immigrants that threaten to overrun the U.S. This 
          research has implications for understanding of covert racist discourse 
          practices as well as the WWW&#146;s role in assisting political groups 
          to create shifting, fluid identities in response to the changing U.S. 
          political climate.</font></p>
