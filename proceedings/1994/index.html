        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
          will to accommodate socially on the part of Barcelona youths is perhaps 
          most fully expressed in their will to accommodate linguistically. The 
          analysis of speech accommodation in this study relies in part on second 
          language acquisition motivation research and is largely qualitative, 
          though frequencies of responses are discussed. Perhaps the most overt 
          of all speech accommodation, code switching, is interlocutor dependent 
          in Catalonia, and so questions of identity and ethnicity move to the 
          fore. The findings indicate that Catalan is seen as an additive ethnic 
          feature for the majority of subjects, while Castilian is at times perceived 
          as subtracted inasmuch as it suppresses Catalan language and the identity 
          it represents. </font>

          Contrasts in Hebrew-English Bilingual Conversation <br>
          <i>Yael Maschler, Hebrew University of Jerusalem &amp; Halfa University 
          </i></font></h4>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Based 
          on analysis of over 20 hours of audiotaped Hebrew-English bilingual 
          conversation, this study concerns two types of discourse contrast in 
          codeswitching situations. The study illustrates the abundance and variety 
          of Hebrew contrastive discourse markers compared with the English ones 
          in the data, thus providing further grammatical evidence supporting 
          previous studies which argue for relatively high tolerance for disagreement 
          in Israeli discourse (Katriel 1986, Maschler in press). The study also 
          concludes that the expression of semantic contrast via language alteration 
          generally overrides the motivation to separate the discourse from its 
          metalingual frame. </font>

          Drag Queens<br>
          <i>Rusty Barrett, UT Austin</i></font></h4>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
          paper explores the possibility of using Myers-Scotton's (1988, 1993) 
          Markedness Model for bi/multilingual code switching to study monolingual 
          style switching. Evidence supporting the applicability of the Markedness 
          Model is provided from a study of style switching in the speech of African 
          American drag queens (African American gay men who cross dress in public).

          Compliment Responses, and Politeness in an African American Community<br>
          <i>Anita Henderson, University of Kansas</i></font></h4>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Based 
          on fieldwork carried out in East St. Louis, Illinois, with African-American 
          speakers, this study is an analysis of compliment behavior in a politeness 
          framework. Following Brown and Levinson (1987), this analysis illuminates 
          how concepts of politeness determine culturally appropriate compliment 
          behavior by (1) assessing appropriate expression of face wants via cultural 
          beliefs, (2) establishing expectations of responses via adjacency pairs, 
          and (3) rank-ordering responses via preference organization. This study 
          provides both a pragmatic analysis of compliments and compliment responses 
          in African-American English and a model of complimenting behavior based 
          on politeness theory. </font>

          Analysis and the Urban-Rural Rift in Javanese Society <br>
          <i>Laine Berman, Georgetown University</i></font></h4>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
          study explores the effects of modernization in the developing world 
          and the ways in which it is altering local identities in Java. These 
          recorded conversational data illustrate the miscommunication that is 
          growing in dissonance and frequency as it offers an intimate glimpse 
          of diverse stances and world views that currently collide within a community 
          previously acclaimed for its elegance and harmony. I analyze talk between 
          two people from the same rural village but whose unequal access to modernizing 
          influences has divided them. I locate the discursive features of this 
          disagreement to see how they may represent a new concept of modern Javanese 
          identity. </font>

          Talk: the Reconstruction of Experience through Narrative among Portuguese 
          Boys<br>
          <i>Julio Alves, Smith College</i></font></h4>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Urban, 
          working-class Portuguese boys regularly narrate their street conflicts 
          in the peer group. In doing so, they collectively decipher the lines 
          of conflict and power in their community. These narratives are more 
          than simple retellings, however. They transform the events to suit the 
          collective interests of the working-class. They are yet another example 
          of the way social relationships are collectively constructed through 
          talk. This paper is a textual analysis of the language and discourse 
          structure of five personal experience narratives about street conflicts 
          between working-class and non-working class (middle-class, Gypsy) boys.

          Story Genres in the Western Highlands of Papua New Guinea<br>
          <i>Francesca Merlan, Sydney University and Indiana Universit</i></font></h4>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
          paper discusses indigenously recognized story types in the Nebilyer 
          Valley, Western Highlands Province, Papua New Guinea, focusing on kange 
          and temani. Though there has been recent suggestion for a neighboring 
          area of the Southern Highlands (LeRoy 1985) that a similar pair may 
          be understood to differ as 'literature' and 'history' (or fiction and 
          non-fiction), no such 'truth value' criterion adequately captures the 
          Nebilyer distinction as locally understood. The paper concentrates on 
          discussion of the texutal strategies which distinguish kange and temani, 
          especially differences in the resources of framing, realization of character, 
          and socio-spatial employment. </font>

          Friend is Pissing Standing Up: Kuna Positional Suffixes in Grammatical 
          Discourse, Poetic, and Socio-Cultural Context<br>
          <i>Joel Sherzer, UT Austin</i></font></h4>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
          the Kuna language, four verbal suffixes indicate the position of the 
          subject of an utterance, in conjunction with expressing ongoing activity. 
          They signify 'horizontal,' 'vertical,' 'sitting,' and 'perched.' In 
          addition to their grammatical and semantic function, these suffixes 
          have an important function in verbal art and play, as well as in metaphorical 
          and symbolic expression, in both everyday and formal/ritual discourse. 
          The study of these suffixes reveals the poetic imagination at the heart 
          of the Kuna language-culture relationship. </font>

          and Pairing in the New Guinea Highlands<br>
          <i>Alan Rumsey, Sydney University and Indiana University</i></font></h4>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While 
          Jakobson's seminal work on parallelism stresses its universality, recent 
          studies of verbal art have revealed interesting cross-cultural differences 
          regarding its canonical forms and uses. This paper concerns its specific 
          forms and uses in Ku Waru- a Papuan language of Highland New Guinea--which 
          I relate to other aspects of Ku Waru language and culture, especially 
          the local emphasis on pairing as the fundamental form of social organization 
          and action. From a Ku Waru perspective there is no reason to separate 
          parallelism as a specifically linguistic phenomenon from the wider social 
          field in which pairing is practiced. </font>

          <i>Akira Satch, Georgetown University</i></font></h4>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Reported 
          speech in Japanese has attracted the attention of scholars because the 
          distinction between direct and indirect speech is said to be blurred. 
          In this paper I describe two types of reported speech which cannot be 
          identified as simply direct or indirect speech in Japanese. Then I argue 
          one type of the "obscure" speech functions as a skillful involvement 
          strategy in Japanese spoken narrative. </font>

          bon, ca!": Conventional Displays of Affect in French<br>
          <i>Carl Blyth, UT Austin</i></font></h4>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Affect, 
          the conventionalized display of emotion or emotional intensity, plays 
          an important role in conversation. In order to interpret a speaker's 
          utterance, interlocutors need to know the affective orientation of the 
          speaker. In fact, interlocutors often respond to the speaker's affect 
          rather than to the prepositional content of the utterance. Affect displays 
          are particularly important to the organization of assessments, the evaluation 
          or judgment of entities and events. It is shown that assessments in 
          informal French conversation are characterized by particular patterns 
          of interaction and by particular linguistic structures. Data informing 
          this study come from two corpora of spontaneous conversational discourse 
          including Canadian and European varieties of French. </font>

          <i>Lilly Lee Chen, Rice University</i></font></h4>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
          notion of face in Chinese is important in both social interaction and 
          the orientation of time and space. The bi-directional concept of Time 
          as expressed by front-back, and go-come for both past and future are 
          explainable in terms of face as contained in the metaphors of queue 
          and walking. Queue expresses the prior-subsequent contrast and has the 
          basic meaning of priority (predecessor, and thus past). Walking is for 
          facing the future. Left-right and front-back spatial orientation is 
          based on the (construed) face (e.g.- the front door) of the referent 
          (e.g.- a house). </font>

          Stories/Revealing Selves: Narratives in the Composition Classroom<br>
          <i>Suzanne Cherry, Texas A &amp; M</i></font></h4>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Teachers 
          use narratives for content-related functions (Strodt-Lopez 1987, 1993), 
          such as examples, explanations, expansion of ideas, and transitions 
          between tasks. Teachers also use narratives for social and rhetorical 
          functions: to interest their audience; to entertain their audience; 
          to fill in 'dead air' space while students work at the blackboard; to 
          be humorous; to identify with their audience; and to build their authority, 
          to counteract or undermine their authority role. In short, narratives 
          are rhetorical strategies for creating and establishing the teacher's 
          persona. Teacher and student perspectives of these narratives, however, 
          do not always agree, perhaps because of the social context of the classroom 
          and perhaps because of the teacher's persona. </font>

          provides an intertextual analysis (Bakhtin, 1986; Fairclough, 1989; 
          Lemke, 1989) of language minority students' stories, which illustrates 
          the individual students' attempts to reconcile conflicting messages 
          they receive about the kind of person they should be, and reflect macro-level 
          US societal tensions between assimilation on the one hand and cultural 
          pluralism on the other. </font>

          Boss is Your "Mother": Japanese Women's Construction of an Authoritative 
          Position in the Workplace<br>
          <i>Yukako Sunaoshi, UT Austin</i></font></h4>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
          work analyzes how two Japanese female managers manipulate language when 
          giving directives to their subordinates. First, directives used by the 
          two women are analyzed and compared with one of Smith's strategies (1992), 
          the Motherese Strategy, and directives used by Japanese mothers to children 
          in actual conversations. Second, other evidence in discourse that appears 
          to help the women create their mother-like position is analyzed. The 
          results suggest that the women's choice of directive forms and theirinte 
          ractions with the subordinates are helping them construct a mother-like 
          and ultimately an authoritative position. The two women are maximizing 
          their power by exploiting the linguistic resources available to them, 
          rather than "talking like men." </font>

          Gendering of Nukulaelae Literacy Practices<br>
          <i>Niko Besnier, Yale University</i></font></h4>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While 
          both women and men on Nukulaelae Atoll (Polynesia) partake in a similar 
          range of literacy practices, gender plays an important role in defining 
          literacy in this community. The link between gender and literacy resides 
          in such factors as the relative salience of particular gendered emotions 
          and the claim to authority inherent in specific literacy practices. 
          The gendering of literacy in this community (and, I propose, in other 
          societies) is thus intrinsically dependent on the particular social 
          practice in which literacy is produced and used. It is also semiotically 
          complex and indexical, which allows for leakage and multiple interpretations.

          Redneck Women's 'Reverse': Language and Gender in American Working-Class 
          Verbal Art<br>
          <i>Aaron Fox, UT Austin</i></font></h4>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
          paper investigates the construction of models of gender identity in 
          rural white working-class ("redneck") verbal art. I analyze redneck 
          women's "reverses"-- i.e., framed performances in which women enact 
          "male" roles and men perform female roles--and examine as well how certain 
          performers create ambiguous genders for their characters. I show how 
          redneck women particularly stereotype male discourse topics, prosodic 
          structures, and paralinguistic gestures. These performances simultaneously 
          critically denaturalize "ordinary" hegemonic relations encoded in gendered 
          speech styles and performatively and affirmatively "renaturalize" the 
          same gendered division of discourse as a positive assertion of redneck 
          cultural identity. </font>

          <i>Chris Hormann, UT Austin</i></font></h4>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While 
          offering us an elegant heuristic for thinking about issues of language 
          and identity, Le Page's hypothesis and its riders (Le Page and Tabouret-Keller, 
          1985) are extremely difficult to operationalize and thus very few researchers 
          have made an attempt to utilize identity theory for practical research 
          purposes. I examine the problems inherent in operationalizing the theory 
          and present parts of my own questionnaire, designed to elicit data on 
          the subjects' linguistic behavior and on variables like identification 
          with the target group, feedback, access, subject, motivation, language 
          analysis and modification abilities, proposing an effective instrument 
          to measure identity theory's parameters. </font>
