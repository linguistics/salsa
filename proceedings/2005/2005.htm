              <p align="justify"><font size="2" color="black" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                paper proposes an approach to the study of kinship as a domain 
                of social relations. The traditional study of kinship was formulated 
                around several problematic assumptions, such as the idea that 
                kinship is fundamentally a system of genealogical relations, or 
                that &quot;kinship systems&quot; can be conceptualized as shared 
                mental models. I argue that neither the genealogical reduction 
                nor a mentalistic approach to kinship is particularly plausible. 
                The difficulty with the first is that kinship terms are frequently 
                used to express fictive, metaphoric or ritual kinship, and thus 
                to express social relations that contradict known genealogical 
                facts. The first half of the paper discusses such &quot;tropic&quot; 
                uses of kinship terms and the way in which language users recognize 
                these uses and their effects. Simply put, the difference between 
                literal and tropic usage depends on whether the semiotic sketch 
                of social relations indexed by the kinterm is congruent with independently 
                readable contextual facts of social relations holding between 
                participants. These tropes can also be normalized as habits of 
                speaking, which, in turn, can iteratively be troped upon.</font><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

            is known about the resources that the blind use in coordinating their 
            interaction with one another. While past research has tried to determine 
            whether the blind are capable of producing certain behaviors, visual 
            impairment has not been traditionally considered as a communication 
            problem. This research is a part on an ongoing study that attempts 
            to understand the interaction of blind in a more holistic way. The 
            study is conducted in the School for the Blind and Visually Impaired 
            and involves videotaping of classroom interaction and naturally occurring 
            dialogues of various age groups within the school. The findings are 
            analyzed frame by frame in order to capture the complexity of the 
            interaction. The main topics analyzed in the study are: the synchronization 
            of gestures and speech within individuals and between individuals; 
            the creation of focused interaction in naturally occurring conversations 
            and in a classroom setting; the organization of audience attention 
            by means of audible gestures; reliance on the tactile sense in explaining 
            ideas and in teaching children &quot;how to feel&quot; and categorize 
            the world; overcoming sensory impairment by manipulating other available 
            cues in time and space.</font></p>

            </font></p>
          <p align="justify"><font size="2" color="black" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
            study of bilingualism in hearing people from deaf families offers 
            an opportunity to analyze how native users of both a signed and a 
            spoken language combine aspects of both languages simultaneously (code 
            blending). Unlike spoken language bilinguals who must stop one language 
            before beginning another, a bimodal bilingual has the capability to 
            speak and sign at the same time. This preliminary research focuses 
            on emails taken from a forum on the Internet for hearing people with 
            deaf parents. Two hundred and seventy five lines from one hundred 
            emails were collected and analyzed. The study shows evidence of strong 
            ASL grammatical influence in these emails (an absence of overt subjects, 
            overt objects, determiners, copula, prepositions) as well as unique 
            structures such as nonstandard verb inflections and overgeneralization 
            of s'. The overall results of this analysis are compared to Internet 
            Relay Chat as described by Werry and Mowbray (2001), and TDD writings 
            (telecommunications device for deaf people) (Mather 1991).</font></p>

              this paper, I analyze the effectiveness of Richard Burr's campaign 
              in the North Carolina 2004 US Senate race. In looking at the transcripts 
              from his ads, I argue that the language of pro-Burr advertisements 
              enabled his campaign to make false claims about his opponent and 
              that the use of casual conversation within his ads implicated meaning 
              which was not entailed. I also contend that Burr's use of phatic 
              communication tactics helped build solidarity with his audience, 
              and finally, that by not identifying the cultural standing of the 
              opinions within them, Burr's ads helped sway undecided voters to 
              his side. In addition, I examine the advertisements of his opponent, 
              Erskine Bowles, to show how his strategy which did not engage in 
              these linguistic tactics contributed to the failure of his campaign.</font></p>

              study were collected during three semesters of fieldwork at an American 
              high school, and they consist of instances in which students engaged 
              in highlighted linguistic performances, speaking directly into the 
              microphone being used to record them. My analysis suggests that 
              these moments are rich sites for understanding identities and ideologies 
              in the local context of the high school. They reveal students' language 
              ideologies pertaining to specific kinds of stereotypical personas 
              (rappers, singers, news reporters) as well as laying bare ideologies 
              of race, sex, and humor. In addition, they provide a glimpse of 
              how rules of linguistic practice, such as what counts as appropriate, 
              funny, or worthy of being recorded, are explicitly negotiated in 
              a context that has been transformed by the presence of a microphone.</font></p>

                discrimination -- those describing episodes in which a racial 
                insult is uttered; and narratives of covert discrimination -- 
                in which tellers conclude that they were discriminated by interpreting 
                the events against their background of similar situations. To 
                convey the sense that they experienced prejudice, tellers rely 
                on the sequential description of verbal actions, or speech acts, 
                during the encounter and on how the perpetrators of discrimination 
                willingly break away from accepted rules of politeness for a typical

                paper focuses on the emergent literacy program of the Grupo de 
                Mujeres por la Paz, an Ixil Mayan women&rsquo;s organization of 
                Nebaj, Guatemala, and the discourses which surround this project. 
                Through a combination of ethnographic approaches to naturally 
                produced language and the methodologies of discourse analysis, 
                I examine the structuring metaphor of the huipil, traditional 
                woven blouses, in the group&rsquo;s discourses about literacy. 
                The discourses the women produce contribute to discussions about 
                the political implications of literacy in indigenous languages, 
                both in the case of Mayan languages and for endangered indigenous 
                languages in general. This paper also builds on the idea that 
                significant aspects of thought and language arise from, and are 
                grounded in, embodiment. Thus the physical experience of weaving 
                huipiles can be used to create meaning in emergent discourses. 
                During a time when Guatemala&rsquo;s political and cultural norms 
                are being reconstructed, the women&rsquo;s words offer a significant 
                opportunity to see the creative and productive power of language

                Japanese women's frequent use of high F0 and wide pitch ranges, 
                researchers have claimed that these are features of Japanese women's 
                language. However, the performative turn has discouraged scholars 
                from assuming a one-to-one mapping between language and gender 
                identity. Viewed from this perspective, Japanese women's language--an 
                ideological construct made up of linguistic resources with gendered 
                meanings -- is available to both men and women for the construction 
                of different personae. This paper examines the production and 
                perception of stereotypically masculine and feminine speech styles 
                in Japanese. Our study results imply that gender norms are enforced 
                differently for Japanese men than for Japanese women. Men who 
                adopt masculine styles may sound impolite, but at least, they 
                conform to gender norms. On the other hand, women who adopt masculine 
                styles--which are already perceived as impolite--are even more 
                impolite because they flout gender norms.</font><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

                use language to unite aspects of their social identities while 
                engaging in feminist social change work. I will also argue that 
                understanding how speakers make use of language to negotiate their 
                social identities in complex multi-layered societies can lead 
                to better understanding of the social meaning of inter-speaker

                and nonverbal behaviors (gestures, head movements, facial expressions, 
                gaze, posture) in conversations involving a person with aphasia. 
                Conversation Analysis will be used to examine how different types 
                of nonverbal behaviors may serve as turn constructional units, 
                either as such in the turn, or as combined with verbal turn constructional 
                units. With the help of videotaped examples from aphasic conversations, 
                it will be demonstrated how a person with aphasia may take different 
                kinds of nonverbal behaviors in use during turn construction activity. 
                The analysis reveals many systematic nonverbal behaviors used 
                by aphasic speakers while constructing turns. Of special interest 
                are extended conversational sequences where participants co-construct 
                understanding on turn-by-turn basis, in a way that a person with 
                aphasia recruits several nonverbal acts with or without lexical 
                elements and the interlocutor produces candidate understandings. 
                The presentation will display, how the participants build conversational 
                context in order to constitute shared meanings, and how they in 
                this way jointly co-construct a conversation.</font></p>

                on the third assumption of creation over time in relation to talk. 
                Drawing on work by Arundale (1999) and van Dijk (1997; 1999), 
                the co-constructive model of talk discussed here incorporates 
                the notions of expectation-based discourse processing and context 
                models by both participants of a dialogue. Arguing for the advantages 
                of using a co-constructive approach to interaction analysis, we 
                then explore the emergent aspect of dialogic meaning and meaning

                and language have been exhaustively examined, yet anonymity remains 
                under theorized. Studies assert that because computer-based communication 
                lacks social cues, it will be hostile. Yet, this position underestimates 
                identifying information in talk and fails to account for countless 
                anonymous, non-hostile, Internet interactions. This paper argues 
                that hostility often results from interlocutors attempts to reduce 
                anonymity. Based on an online ethnographic study, this paper examines 
                real-time conversation to see how speakers use linguistic resources 
                to reveal themselves as technical experts. Maintaining Internet 
                anonymity is possible. However, actual levels of anonymity must 
                be investigated in specific contexts. This study analyzes the 
                interplay between identity and anonymity and provides a more nuanced 
                approach to anonymity theorization. Further, it contributes to 
                computer-based communication research by questioning how unspecified 
                levels of anonymity cause hostility. Instead this research shows 
                that hostility is used to reduce anonymity during interactive

                framing decision scenarios. We asked undergraduates to read different 
                versions of a managerial decision scenario and to choose between 
                two response options. The scenario versions differed in the number 
                of business-as-sports idioms (e.g., &quot;sales team&quot;) used 
                to describe situational attributes. People's preference for analogically 
                consistent response options was significantly influenced by the 
                number of idioms present. However, those who preferred the consistent 
                option rarely referred to the analogy when explaining their choices, 
                instead referring to scenario attributes that did not differ across 
                scenario versions. These results suggest that idioms can exert 
                an implicit influence on decision-making, compelling people to 
                strive for analogical consistency without subjective awareness.</font></p>

                  <p align="justify"><font size="2" color="black" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Students 
                    of color from low-income neighborhoods who do college-prep 
                    school work have to negotiate the identities that they have 
                    developed in their neighborhoods with the academic identities 
                    demanded by this educational setting.<br>
                    <br>
                    The Preuss School established in 1999 at UCSD as our campus 
                    response to the elimination of Affirmative Action in University 
                    of California admissions, offers a college-prep curriculum 
                    exclusively to students of color from low-income backgrounds 
                    in grades 6-12. Recognizing that the entering students may 
                    lack preparation for this rigorous instruction, the school 
                    adds a comprehensive system of academic and social supports, 
                    including a longer school day, longer school year, and &quot;Saturday 
                    Academies;&quot; tutoring by UCSD undergraduates; mentoring 
                    by community members; and parent participation. The school 
                    has obtained a certain measure of success: 90% of the first 
                    graduating class attend 4 year colleges.<br>
                    <br>
                    Students are bussed to Preuss-which takes them out of neighborhoods 
                    where they grew up and now go to school on a big university 
                    situated in wealthy neighborhood. Using the language students 
                    use to describe their experiences, a variety of responses 
                    to this situation will be presented, including: &quot;code 
                    switching&quot; (in which students adopt an academic identity 
                    at school and maintain their home identity in the neighborhood), 
                    &quot;caught in the middle&quot; (in which students feel torn 
                    between school and parental expectations). We do not find 
                    much evidence of students expressing the need to 'act white.'<br>
                    <br>
                    I will speculate on the institutional arrangements that contribute 
                    to these expressions of identity.</font></p>

                  <p align="justify"><font size="2" color="black" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
                    many communities, children's pretend play is a context for 
                    acquiring narrative skills, role-specific registers, and meta-communicative 
                    awareness, among other key features of language use. As a 
                    vernacular dramatic form, pretend play may involve the creative 
                    incorporation of characters, settings, and plots drawn from 
                    mass media as well as everyday social interaction. This paper 
                    illustrates the multiply mediated intertextuality of a &quot;playing 
                    school&quot; performance by Miskitu indigenous children in 
                    the multi-ethnic, multi-lingual community of Corn Island, 
                    Nicaragua. Transcribed excerpts reveal the fluid shifting 
                    of linguistic codes and communicative modalities in children's 
                    play, interweaving texts from everyday social interaction, 
                    mass media, and written material. The pretend play dialogue 
                    is not merely a reproduction of mass-mediated scenes; through 
                    the manipulation of performance frames and disputes over acceptable 
                    action, it becomes a local medium of peer socialization as 
                    children negotiate the boundaries of appropriate discourse 
                    and behavior.</font></p>

                    nearly 500 years the Spanish language has had a major impact 
                    on the culture of the Southwestern portion of the United States, 
                    and many people in this area seek opportunities for their 
                    children to become bilingual. However, for native English 
                    speakers the goal of bilingualism is often unattained because 
                    of the stratified society that we live in. In this essay, 
                    I argue that because there is an imbalance between Spanish 
                    and English in the greater society, there is an imbalance 
                    of success in Spanish-English dual-immersion bilingual programs 
                    in the area. Furthermore, the imbalance of the status of Spanish 
                    and English in New Mexico is not due simply to greater numbers 
                    of English speakers versus Spanish speakers, but rather to 
                    a long and intricate history of the state. The data for this 
                    study, which were collected in a dual-immersion preschool 
                    classroom in New Mexico, suggest that children as young as 
                    four years old already view an imbalance in the status of 
                    the two languages in their society.</font><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">

                    <i>Yikal Maya Than</i>, a magazine of Maya literature which

                    is related to the creation of the image of Maya Indians. Discussing 
                    the image of Maya Indians presented in Other's discourse, 
                    it is important to note that this magazine is one of the earliest

                    paper concentrates on the process of creating a standard orthography 
                    for the Kuna language, an indigenous language spoken by approximately 
                    50,000 to 70,000 people in Panama. It is based on the discourse-centered 
                    approach, using excerpts of spoken and written discourse from 
                    Kuna scholars, writers and activists to show how the development 
                    of a standard orthopgraphy is being conceived of by the Kuna 
                    community. I also examine how the Kuna community is looking 
                    to preserve cultural meaning in orthography by maintaining 
                    the morphophonemic structure of words, expressing important 
                    cultural understandings that can be obscured in phonetic writing 
                    systems. This paper explores how imbuing writing with meanings, 
                    beliefs and cultural understandings is why and how a written 
                    abstraction of a language becomes a writing system. By looking 
                    at how the Kuna are conceptualizing and realizing a standard 
                    writing system, it becomes clear how written Western traditions 
                    have structured literacy and how other knowledge systems, 
                    like that of the Kuna, are challenging Western notions of 
                    writing.</font></p>

                    controversy about whether AAVE's features come completely 
                    from English settler dialects (the Anglicist position) or 
                    show evidence of creole influence (the Creolist position) 
                    has been joined more recently by the provocative claim that 
                    AAVE is a creation of the 20th century, an instance of linguistic 
                    divergence fuelled by unprecedented social segregation as 
                    Blacks migrated to the urban North and West. Some feel that 
                    there is or should be a consensus on the correctness of the 
                    Anglicist and divergence positions, based on the quantitative

                    and opposition between Blacks and Whites were marked enough

                    In the Jerusalem Women in Black vigil, women stand silently 
                    for an hour on Friday afternoons, dressed in black, holding 
                    hand-shaped signs that read, in Hebrew, Arabic and English, 
                    &quot;Stop the Occupation&quot;. As Bauman and Briggs have 
                    argued for other types of performances, both the form and 
                    the content of the vigil emerge from the performance itself, 
                    so that no two instances of the vigil are exactly the same. 
                    Each week, the women on the vigil along with passersby and 
                    counter-demonstrators, co-create the form and meanings of 
                    the vigil. I examine the linguistic and semiotic components 
                    of the vigil and the negotiation of these components and their 
                    meanings by the participants in the weekly performance of 
                    the vigil. The co-construction of the vigil's form and meanings 
                    blur the performer-audience distinction almost completely. 
                    At the heart of this negotiation is a struggle over the meanings 
                    of political consensus and dissent, and of gender roles in 
                    Israeli society, of the word (and practice of) &quot;occupation&quot;,

                    remains to be learned about the relationship between embodiment--the

                    speaker performance. Although some recent contributions have 
                    been made to these issues (e.g. Kendon 2004, Goodwin 2000, 
                    Heath 2002), Gibbs (2003) still asserts that most research 
                    ignores the importance of embodied behaviors. This study uses 
                    discourse analysis (cf. Fairclough 1995, Scollon &amp; Scollon 
                    2001) to examine the part embodiment, stance, and identity 
                    play in narrating and organizing aspects of the birth experience. 
                    Data come from a videotaped group interaction among 4 females 
                    aged 31-51 years. The women use particular embodied communicative 
                    practices to convey the role of and/or changes in the woman's 
                    and/or baby's body during pregnancy and childbirth (opening 
                    of the cervix, induction of labor, physical exposure, crowning 
                    of the baby's head, etc.). These practices are also used to 
                    show agreement and/or disagreement with others' statements 
                    about childbirth and to co-construct shared identities.</font>
