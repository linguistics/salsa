            paper discusses cooperation in communication, with a view to future 
            cooperative human-computer interfaces. First, cooperation and multimodal 
            communication are defined and characterized. It is then proposed that 
            cooperation can be extended into a notion of "mutual flexibility"
            and this notion is subsequently characterized. In a following section, 
            an empirical study of how verbal and nonverbal gestural means are 
            used to achieve flexibility are presented. Finally, some possible 
            implications for the design of future interactive systems are mentioned.

          <i><b>The Role of Russian Function Words in Urban Colloquial Uzbek</b></i><br>
          <br>
          Although a number of scholars researching language contact have pointed 
          out the borrowing of core vocabulary including function words and discourse 
          markers (Bernsten 1990; Campbell 1987; Higa 1979; Mougeon &amp; Beniak 
          1990; Mougeon 1998; Myers-Scotton 1993; Scotton &amp; Okeju 1973), the 
          exact role of these loans in the borrowing language has not been studied 
          in great detail. In this paper I present data from the virtually unresearched 
          language contact setting of Russian and Uzbek in Tashkent, the capital 
          of Uzbekistan. I discuss Russian function words found in colloquial 
          speech of Tashkent residents. I show that these loans have acquired 
          a status distinct from any of their Uzbek equivalents: an affective 
          function of expressing emphasis. I also argue that Russian function 
          words belong to the informal register of Uzbek, and as such are likely 
          to remain unaffected by current language reform.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
          this paper, I analyze an interaction between two Spanish/English bilinguals 
          in a public setting: a television talk show interview on Telemundo, 
          a Spanish language network in the United States. Using the framework 
          of conversation analysis, I investigate how the two speakers actively 
          attempt to create a bilingual identity through language use, and how 
          their attempts are either ratified or undermined by their interlocutor. 
          In addition, I examine the significance of the interaction within the 
          greater context of bilingualism, Spanish in the U.S. and inter-Latino 
          interaction in the United States.</font></p>

            This study investigates language attitude and cultural identity within 
            the national contexts in three European republics of the former Soviet 
            Union: Lithuania, Ukraine, and Moldova. Results of a questionnaire 
            given to two hundred subjects indicate that the cultural and historical 
            differences among these republics have significantly affected the 
            language attitudes of speakers in the three contexts.</font></p>

            <i><b>How White Hegemonic English Reproduces Racial and Gender Hierarchies</b></i><br>
            This paper shows how a local linguistic practice, which I call indexing 
            the underspecified center, directly constitutes, reproduces and conceals 
            racial and gender hierarchies by tapping into interlocutors' uncritically
            examined, hegemonic ideologies about what kind of social identities
            occupy the unmarked, rhetorical "center" in North American society.</font></p>

              use of language by mass media celebrities potentially both reflects
              sociolinguistic patterns and influences language change. Martha
              Stewart is a complex figure who has become a powerful corporate
              executive through representing the traditional woman's role of homemaker
              and commodifying her vision of upper-middle-class "good taste."
              Martha Stewart's linguistic presentation of self on her television
              show is analyzed in terms of three interrelated frames: politeness,
              credibility, and authenticity. Her language use is discussed in
              relation to scholarship on gender and language, and her potential
              for motivating language change is considered, as well as appropriate
              methodology for measuring any such influence.</font></p>

              the Cultural Concept of Self in Belian, a Petalangan Healing Ritual 
              in Indonesia</b></i><br>
              <br>
              This paper analyzes a performance of the Belian, a shamanic healing 
              ritual practiced by the Petalangan people in Indonesia to discuss 
              the tensions between situatedness (contingency) and transcendence
              (analogy) of ritual speech. I analyze the usage of address and referential 
              terms and personal pronouns, by which a shaman mediates the present 
              context and the supernatural world during the performance. My concerns 
              focus on the interrelations between indexicality and iconicity of 
              the Belian performance and the importance of the Petalangan concept 
              of the 'relational' self, which mediates 'contextualization' and
              'entextualization' processes of the ritual.</font></p>

              This paper describes the form and structure of the discourse of

              of media pharmaceutical advertisements. The study is based on the 
              analysis of 58 ads from the popular press. I argue that these ads 
              are a new marketing genre that is shaped by the regulations of the 
              Food and Drug Administration and is modulated by the audience and 
              context for each ad. I provide a description of the genre and show 
              how gender and the nature of the malady to be treated trigger different 
              discourse patterns. Further, I show the influence of governmental 
              regulations and how they mediate doctor/patient communication.</font></p>

              <i><b>The Dubbing of The Simpsons: Cultural Appropriation, Discursive 
              Manipulation and Divergencies </b></i><br>
              <br>
              Analysis of the dubbing of The Simpsons offers insights into possible 
              differences in discursive identity between France and Qu&eacute;bec, 
              two cultures that share a common language. Translations done in 
              France and in Qu&eacute;bec (a province of Canada and enclave of 
              the French-speaking population in North America) for The Simpsons 
              show various strategies of cultural appropriation, especially concerning 
              elements considered intrusive by the target culture. The series 
              is perceived as a children's show and the subversive discourse of 
              the original is toned down accordingly. Dubbing stands as a buffer 
              zone between two cultures and is also a potent tool for lingustic 
              standardization.</font></p>

              This paper explores various ways in which the Kuna language is related 
              to the Kuna natural environment. It will examine words for animals 
              and plants, the organization of words into semantic systems, variation 
              in the use of these words, and the use of the language of ecology 
              in Kuna speaking practices. While not about language endangerment 
              per se, to the degree that Kuna ecology is in danger, the language 
              that is intimately related to ecology is also in danger.</font></p>

              variation and change in this type of speech community. A consideration

              as a provisional alternative for studies of language variation on

              This study investigates Japanese referent honorifics in reference 
              to socially distant third parties. Thirteen conversations between 
              native speakers reveal that such honorifics are rarely used. Additionally, 
              the addressee-oriented nature of Japanese honorifics is proposed, 
              based on a correlation between addressee honorifics and referent 
              honorifics, suggesting interdependent nature of these honorifics. 
              Another observation made in this study is that stylemixing between 
              referent honorifics and non-honorific forms in reference to an individual 
              might be triggered by changes in the speaker's attitudes toward
              the referent.</font></p>
