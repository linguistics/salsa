        <i>Rudolf P. Gaudio, Stanford University</i></b><br>
        <br>
        Hausa gay men's descriptions of their sexual relationships reveal a dialectic 
        of adherence to and subversion of mainstream cultural norms regarding 
        gender, age and socioeconomic status. In many gay relationships, feminine- 
        and masculine-identified partners assume interactional roles with regard 
        to sex, money and other symbolic forms which are modeled after traditional 
        heterosexual institutions. But gay men also establish liaisons which disrupt 
        the expected power arrangements conventionally associated with sex. This 
        sort of sexual subversion is limited, however, by the fact that the discursive 
        frames within which Hausa gay men discuss their sexual relationships share 
        a common patriarchal basis with mainstream Hausa society.</font></p>

        <i>Naoko Ogawa and Janet S. (Shibamoto) Smith, UC-Davis</i></b><br>
        <br>
        The present proposal continues a study of the speech of gay men in urban 
        Japan. Data drawn from the speech of six gay and/or transvestite men are 
        analyzed for 1) pronoun use, 2) sentence final particles, 3) postposing, 
        4) intonation, and 5) rhetorical self-affirmation particle n 'um'. We 
        demonstrate that the speech patterns of the gay male community in Japan, 
        as the speech patterns of the better-studied heterosexual female- and 
        male-sex classes, are complex, but begin to establish a framework within 
        which the range of gay male speech patterns may be subsumed and to align 
        this range with those of the more established sex classes.</font></p>

        knowledge in a Tokyo ccorporate office<br>
        <i>Miyako Inoue, Washington University</i></b> <br>
        <br>
        The metapragmatic discourses of two women managers in a Tokyo corporate 
        office are examined. The purpose is to question the prevailing image of 
        Japanese &quot;women's language&quot; as an obligatory and unitary form 
        correlated with a &quot;female role&quot; inescapable whenever a woman 
        speaks. The metapragmatic discourses examined here reflect not the micro-situation 
        of a woman communicating interpersonally, but rather the macro-structural 
        factors of company organization, and variable life chances associated 
        with class and gender positioning in an evolving Japanese economy. The 
        paper also shows how creative and reflexive agency is reflected in the 
        metapragmatics of these two women.</font></p>

        <i>Peggy Swartzel Lott, UT-Austin</i></b><br>
        <br>
        In this paper I examine a few signed stories in order to track the shifting 
        gaze of signers in relation to the overall rhetorical and aesthetic structures 
        of their narratives. Videotaped excerpts illustrate particular patterns 
        of eye movement as well as the affective intensity of a relentless gaze 
        that insistently draws viewers' attention to particular points. The analysis 
        is then used to speculate about the dynamics of viewer response to the 
        compelling intersection of an outward engagement between eyes with an 
        inwardly probing question strategically positioned at key points in ASL 
        storytelling practice.</font></p>

        Popoluca discourse performance<br>
        <i>Kay Sammons, UT-Austin</i></b><br>
        <br>
        With respect to a correlation between narrative construction and audience 
        reception of messages disseminated through discourse performance identified 
        by Russian scholar V.N. Voloshinov, traditional Sierra Popoluca narrative 
        performances are shown to utilize an especially linear style in reporting 
        speech that encourages dogmatic acceptance on the part of the audience, 
        while other genres, such as recent historical narrative and conversational 
        speech, demonstrate a much wider range of rhetorical construction that 
        can vary from extremely linear to more subjective, pictorial styles. This 
        variation with regard to generic constraints encourages dogmatic reception 
        of traditional narrative performance while providing an important rhetorical 
        tool that can be manipulated to influence audience reception of messages 
        contained in performance of other genres. </font></p>

        <b><a name="woodbury"></a>The poetics &amp; rhetoric of overlap in a sample 
        of Yup'ik men's house speech<br>
        <i>Anthony C. Woodbury, UT-Austin</i><br>
        </b><br>
        In a 3-hour recording of elderly Yup'ik men conversing in a traditional 
        men's house, conversational overlap is an extant but constrained phenomenon 
        with specific rules of use, contrary to earlier work on both English and 
        various arctic and subarctic Native American languages. It has these characteristics: 
        (A) It occurs mainly among social equals; (B) It occurs in conversation 
        and narrative; (C) It is restricted to utterances of agreement, including 
        agreement expletives, repetition, ratifying completion of the other's 
        utterance, and independent amplification; (D) It occurs within a potentially 
        utterance- final word; (E) The first speaker ordinarily completes his 
        utterances despite the second speaker's appearance; thereafter he is free 
        to resume the floor. Otherwise, pauses between and within turns are relatively 
        long.</font></p>

        <b><a name="carleton"></a>Rhetorical organization of Chichewa discourse<br>
        <i>Troi Carleton, UT-Austin</i></b><br>
        <br>
        In analyzing oral text, &quot;there are at least five potentially independent 
        types of recurrent, hierarchic organization on which poetic representation 
        has been based: pause phrasing, prosodic phrasing, syntactic constituency, 
        global form-content parallelism, and adverbial-particle phrasing.&quot; 
        (Woodbury, 1985:176). These components are autonomous to the extent that 
        they interact but are neither dependent upon nor necessarily perfectly 
        aligned with one another. This paper shows how several of these independent 
        components manifest themselves in traditional Chichewa (Bantu: Malawi) 
        narratives. In particular, it discusses the relationship between intonational 
        form and its corresponding function as it interacts with the textual content 
        of the narrative, showing how these two independent systems of organization 
        align to convey meaning.</font></p>

        <b><a name="mageneau"></a>&quot;Leaders,&quot; &quot;farmers&quot; and 
        &quot;ordinary Americans&quot;: A critical discourse analysis of Democratic 
        and Republican speeches to the American public<br>
        <i>Keller S. Mageneau and Gabriella Modan, Georgetown University </i></b><br>
        <br>
        In this work we show how opposing parties strategically use language to 
        shape public ideology, and we explore the intertexutality of public discourse, 
        linking the speeches to mass-media accounts of election results. In post 
        mid-term election speeches by President Clinton and Republican Governor 
        Mike Levitt, each speaker uses person deixis, jargon, and syntactic roles 
        to construct alignments with governmental bodies or `ordinary Americans'. 
        Media coverage portrayed the elections as a massive blow for Clinton and 
        huge victory for Republicans. Viewed within this context, Clinton's speech 
        is process oriented (Fairclough 1989); using the aforementioned strategies, 
        he focuses on social/ideological change by giving ordinary Americans an 
        active position, as enthusiastic members of the Clinton team, in shaping 
        the nation. Levitt's discourse is structure oriented, focused on naturalizing 
        ideological assumptions; he highlights Republican leadership, in line 
        with the media's vision of Republicans as the solution to problems.</font></p>

        <i>G. Burns Cooper, University of Alaska-Fairbanks</i></b><br>
        <br>
        Recordings of poetry readings have characteristics of both written and 
        spoken language. Their intonation patterns are not explained well by current 
        theories of intonational meaning, which were developed for more interactive 
        discourse situations. Instead, the intonational contours are largely motivated 
        by other performance objectives: creating the proper &quot;poetic&quot; 
        atmosphere, highlighting parallelism, increasing the cohesion or rhythmicity 
        of key passages, emphasizing particular words and phrases, emphasizing 
        dialect differences, and perhaps others. Salience and (in)completion play 
        their expected roles, but other suggested discourse influences do not 
        appear well-motivated for these texts.</font></p>

        <i>Marta Lucia de Gerdes, UT-Austin</i></b><br>
        <br>
        This paper gives an ethnographic context of radio broadcasts by the Kuna 
        of Panama, and analyzes the use of language in these speech events. The 
        emphasis is on the poetics of the grammar, in particular the organization 
        and interaction of prosodic elements and the way in which such organization 
        is meaningful in the structure of Kuna discourse. I conclude that Kuna 
        radio broadcasts are more than a cut-and-paste of Kuna speech onto a &quot;universal&quot; 
        standard format for radio news. They evidence verbal artistic features 
        and dialogic patterning characteristic of well studied face to face Kuna 
        genres.</font></p>

        <a name="kurz"></a>The use of prepositions, articles and simplification 
        in contact varieties of German<br>
        <i>Claudia Kurz, Ohio State University </i></b><br>
        <br>
        This study investigates the use of prepositions and definite articles 
        in two contact varieties of German, one spoken by three foreign workers 
        living in Berlin, the other by three Bosnian refugees in Munich. From 
        a total of 150 utterances per speaker, the forms investigated are tabulated 
        to show matches and mismatches with the norms of native German. The extent 
        of restrictive simplification is higher in Foreign Workers' German than 
        in the refugee speech. Since the first language is Serbo-Croatian for 
        all speakers, interference is ruled out to account for the difference. 
        Restrictive simplification, however, is inversely related to the degree 
        of speaker motivation. The group with a lower degree of restrictive simplification 
        in their grammars, Bosnian refugees, confesses a high motivation for integration 
        into the German host community. The higher degree of simplification in

        <br>
        This paper examines language choice conflicts at a political-cultural 
        festival in rural highland Ecuador. Bilingualism in Spanish and Quichua 
        is the norm in this community. Quichua is an important symbol of indigenous 
        ethnic identity, and is also linked to women's roles. In this case one 
        participant preferred Spanish; her choice was evaluated as conflicting 
        with gender and ethnic roles. Cast by organizers in terms of making communication 
        easier for indigenous women, the choice of Quichua for the event in effect 
        limited their linguistic choices. It thus constrained the linguistic behavior 
        of those whose behavior it was designed to reflect.</font></p>

        The objective of my study is to investigate the relationship among ethnic

        Latina girls in a northern California high school. I will employ the methodology 
        of discourse analysis, coupled with ethnographic fieldwork, to test my 
        hypothesis that patterns of discourse variation (specifically, patterns 
        of codeswitching (CS) and especially differences in the matrix language) 
        in this community are the product of three factors: (1) language dominance 
        in Spanish or English, (2) Chicana or Mexicana ethnic identity, and (3) 
        gang affiliation.</font></p>

        This study examines the use of the formal/informal distinction in second 
        person pronouns in German. Using descriptive data on the translation of 
        American films into German, this paper demonstrates many of the ways in 
        which prescriptive rules for the implementation of du and Sie may be in 
        conflict with norms of usage. Based on the model first outlined by Brown 
        and Gilman (1960), I thus show how formulaic guidelines for the dubbing 
        of American films and television programs into German fail to reflect 
        the complex interplay between language and social life found otherwise 
        in the community. </font></p>

        In this paper I critically analyze the distinction between institutional

        analysis. The empirical focus of this paper is a close analysis of an 
        interaction between an African-American police officer and an African-American 
        homeless woman who wants to make a burglary report. I analyze this interaction 
        by using the Bakhtinian notion of heteroglossia as well as Black feminist 
        social theory to understand the particular ways in which &quot;ordinary/familiar&quot; 
        and &quot;institutional/formal&quot; spheres interpenetrate one another 
        in the police officer's attempt to shape the outcome of this interaction, 
        as well as to understand the ways in which the complainant's own interpretive 
        efforts resist this shaping.</font></p>

        <br>
        Are phonetic transcriptions a product of what the transcriber believes 
        a sound should be or a product of what is actually produced? Since much 
        of sociolinguistics and dialectology utilize transcriptions as the basis 
        for derving data, it is crucial that we explore and understand the limitations 
        of this tool. The validity and reliability of phonetic transcriptions 
        (of 2 speech styles) by three linguists is being studied. An unfamiliar 
        language was chosen to control for native speaker filtering and to control 
        for the transcribers being phonologically influenced. This paper reports 
        on the findings of inter- and intratranscriber reliability and validity 
        comparisons with native speaker produced transcriptions.</font></p>

        <b><a name="gordon"></a>Sound symbolism as an explanation for sex-based 
        variation in language <br>
        <i>Matthew Gordon, University of Michigan</i></b><i><br>
        </i><br>
        Many explanations have been offered to account for the widespread phenomenon 
        of sexual differentiation in language. Sociolinguists have been especially 
        concerned with this issue but have had limited success finding comprehensive 
        solutions. This paper suggests that one reason for the sociolinguists' 
        difficulty in explaining sex differentiation lies in their fundamental 
        belief in the arbitrariness of the linguistic sign. Suspending that belief 
        opens new avenues of explanation. Using evidence from diverse languages, 
        I suggest that a non-arbitrary relationship exists between the social 
        category &quot;female&quot; and certain sounds, namely palatal consonants 
        and fronted and/or raised vowels. This hypothesis is discussed in the 
        broader context of sound symbolism with a focus on its diachronic implications.</font></p>

        <b><a name="coles"></a>An emerging alternative to Spanish vowel linking<br>
        <i>Felice Coles, University of Mississippi</i></b><br>
        <br>
        Spanish sinalefa is a standard phonetic process in which adjacent vowels 
        across syllables are pronounced as one long vowel in casual speech (Barrutia 
        &amp; Schwegler 1994): [es.ta:ki] 'he/she/it is here.' An alternative 
        to sinalefa can be heard in recent Spanish soap operas, in which an [h] 
        marks the separation of the two vowels: [mi.&amp;radic;i.&amp;part;a.ha.si] 
        'my life thus far.' This epenthetic aspiration appears when two identical 
        vowels come into contact at word boundaries, when speaking Caribbean Spanish 
        where [s] aspiration and deletion is already a dialect feature, and in 
        longer narratives. This feature has been judged in a preliminary survey 
        as a stylistic variant, used for emphasis or emoting in performances.

        <i>Joel Sherzer, UT-Austin</i></b><br>
        <br>
        Reduplication is often cited as a grammatical/semantic process which is 
        iconic, that is one which directly and obviously connects sound and meaning. 
        There is considerable cross-linguistic consistency in the meaning and 
        function of reduplication. Different patterns in the semantic and socio-cultural 
        functioning of reduplication are illustrated with examples from Classical 
        Nahuatl, Kuna, Balinese, and English. Reduplication can be seen as an 
        important aspect of all languages when language is viewed in socio-cultural 
        context and when the playful and esthetic functions of language are considered 
        to be as important as the expression of reference.</font></p>

        This critical discourse analysis investigates linguistic accommodation 
        and resistance (Giroux 1983) to Standard English in an urban American 
        high school. Unlike most Standard English / Vernacular English studies, 
        which focus on quantitative-based studies of variation of sentence-level 
        syntactic features, this study looks at standard/vernacular language continuum 
        as it pertains to persuasive (rhetorical) discourse. The data is taken 
        from a high school class in which a law school student, in teaching a 
        course about law, attempts to apprentice his students into using prestigious 
        &quot;standard&quot; persuasive discourse registers.</font></p>

        <br>
        This paper will explore the multifaceted challenges faced by indigenous 
        linguists in creating a practical writing system for highland Mazateco, 
        a Popolucan language spoken by approximately 77,000 speakers in southern 
        Mexico. While indigenous intellectuals view the creation of a standardized 
        writing system as the first step in promoting literacy in the Mazateco
        language, local debates about language and literacy are in fact strongly 
        informed by the historically contentious social and political relations 
        that exist both within and between Mazateco communities. Through ethnographic 
        and linguistic examples, the paper will show the complex relationship 
        between language and politics in the Sierra Mazateca.</font></p>
