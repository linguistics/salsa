                <em><strong>Changing Discourse Structures in News Coverage of 
                the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict</strong></em> </font></p>
              <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
                paper describes a discourse analysis of the newspaper coverage 
                of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict during the period April through 
                July, 2003. A sample of newspaper stories was collected from five 
                major American newspapers and a discourse analysis was conducted 
                on the linguistic structures, textual properties and stylistic 
                devices of the stories in the sample. The purpose of the research 
                was twofold: (1) to ascertain whether the discourse structures 
                identified in a previous study for the period April through July, 
                2002, were still being used a year later, and (2) to discover
                changes in the coverage that may have arisen due to changes in 
                the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and/or in the network of communication 
                practices which influence the construction of news discourse. 
                The analysis of the news stories in the 2003 sample reveals that 
                news coverage of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has significantly 
                changed from the previous year. The results indicate that the 
                news frame for the reporting of events in Israel and Palestine
                has changed from a perspective which focuses on the words and 
                actions of civilians to a perspective which emphasizes the words 
                and actions of government officials. </font> </p>

            <em><strong>Being Frank: Ideology Construction and Intertextuality 
            in the Tobacco Industry&#8217;s &#8220;Frank Statement&quot;</strong></em></font></p>
          <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
            paper uses critical discourse analysis methods to examine the linguistic 
            construction of the tobacco industry's 50-year battle against public
            health science. It does so by examining the evolution of a key tobacco
            industry document, the Frank Statement. Ideology construction and
            intertextuality comprise the two main research threads of this paper.
            First, how is language in the Frank Statement manipulated in order
            to impart an ideology of rational risk appraisal? To that end,
            this paper examines the presuppositions exhibited in the Frank Statement
            about an idealized smoker (addressee). Second, how does the Frank
            Statement function intertextually? How has the tobacco industry recycled
            phraseology over the years so as to normalize its claims? In order
            to investigate intertextuality, we have located numerous linguistic 
            strings from the Frank Statement in other documents.The Frank Statement 
            was commissioned as a response to evidence of smoking health risks.
            It set the tobacco industry's discursive agenda, apropos public 
            health, by questioning experimentation, rejecting statistics, and 
            conveying an image of the tobacco industry as a rational party. This 
            paper elucidates the discourse strategies of the Frank Statement and 
            traces how those strategies diffused into the wide-spread campaigns 
            of misinformation and manipulation in the intervening years. </font></p>

            <em><strong>The Habit of Being Jicarilla: Subordination, Nominalization 
            and Agency in Jicarilla Apache Narrative</strong></em></font></p>
          <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
            paper examines a range of narrative styles in Jicarilla Apache in 
            order to explore the use of clause combination in expressing speaker 
            agency and subjectivity. Specifically, we will examine two ways in 
            which speakers are able to utilize nominalizing and subordinating 
            markers in the construction of oral narratives, and how such forms 
            can serve as resources for Jicarilla speakers in the creation of texts 
            reflecting Apache language ideologies. The data, which consists of 
            three types of texts: narratives outlining a procedure, personal narratives 
            and folktales, demonstrate that clause-combining with the nominalizing 
            ?i suffix and the subodinator ?go are central components of a style 
            that is characterized by a marked withdrawal of responsibility for 
            the events being related in the narrative. Speakers judge narratives 
            told using these devices to be stylistically more Jicarilla, and 
            that using these constructions helps them to &quot;get into the habit 
            of being Jicarilla.&quot; Elicited narratives show the least amount 
            of nominalization and subordination, while personal narrative and 
            more spontaneous speech show a great deal more of these more complex 
            constructions, enabling the speaker to distance him or herself from 
            the claims being made within the speech event. </font></p>

              the goal of documenting the particular form of Tiwa or Tewa, respectively, 
              used at each pueblo. Concomitantly, importance has been placed on 
              only including lexical items agreed to be indigenous to each language, 
              resulting in purging loan words from English, Spanish and other 
              native languages of the area, or creating new forms to replace those 
              currently in use. This approach seemingly contrasts with efforts 
              at promoting heritage language use at Cochiti and Acoma Pueblos, 
              both of which have rejected using written materials and have stressed 
              emersion in the Keres language as the central tenet of revitalization. 
              This paper examines these divergent techniques used by Pueblo tribes, 
              arguing that all projects reflect components of a shared linguistic 
              ideology of purism, but that this ideology is exhibited in different 
              approaches. However, the projects at Sandia and Nambe Pueblos are 
              also informed by ideologies indexing the relationship of language 
              to sovereignty and the privileging of the referential function of 
              language. Thus, the maintenance and shifting of both traditional 
              and emergent language ideologies can be used to explain these four 
              efforts at revitalization and the varying methods used by these 
              Pueblo tribes to promote heritage language use. </font></p>

              Rooms</strong></em> </font></p>
            <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although 
              Internet chat rooms seem body-free spaces, participants tend to 
              embody the interactions that take place in cyberspace (Sunden, 2002). 
              By examining what people do in and with their talk, I examine the 
              construction of physicality as it unfolds in conversations taking 
              place in five dating chat rooms. The analysis shows a variety of 
              linguistic and graphic strategies that result in three types of 
              physicality that break the boundaries between the real and the virtual. 
              Some strategies, such as age/sex/location schema, self-descriptions, 
              or references to actions performed by bodies, bring the real,
              material body to the foreground. Other strategies, such as the use 
              of graphic features, provide a visual and aural dimension to the 
              written messages, which results in discursive bodies that are as 
              close to material bodies as they are to virtual bodies. Finally, 
              screen names and alter personae construct virtual bodies that are 
              detached from the people they supposedly represent and inhabit a 
              space that is purely interactional. My study contributes to a better 
              understanding of the linguistic practices of Internet chats, provides 
              evidence of the blurry line between material and virtual bodies, 
              and underscores the idea that bodies are a physical as well as a 
              discursive reality.</font></p>

                Situational Stance: Towards a New Model </strong></em></font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Traditional 
                analyses describe Japanese honorific use as determined by situational 
                factors such as formality and the social status of the addressee 
                or referent. The traditional model is inadequate to account for 
                actual patterns of honorific use in which speakers rountinely 
                shift honorific levels within a single situational context. This 
                paper analyses the use of humble forms for self-reference
                in the context of speeches at Japanese wedding receptions. Rather
                than consistently using humble forms throughout their entire speech,
                wedding speakers shifted between humble and non-humble verb forms
                to index shifts in their stance towards the speech situation and
                the social role of wedding speaker. Humble forms were used
                for speech acts in which the speaker announced his/her actions
                in the conventionalized role of wedding speaker. By contrast,
                speakers shifted to non-humble forms to distance themselves from
                and comment upon their performance in the wedding speaker
                role. The data demonstrate that the use of humble forms cannot
                be accounted for solely by external situational factors, but rather
                indexes the speaker's stance towards the situation and the social
                persona s/he wishes to project. </font></p>

                In adult comedy or adult humorous turns in conversation one can 
                see placement of humor in the conversation, addressing shared 
                perspectives and issues, picking a target every ally can share, 
                using code switches effectively, deploying style features either 
                to mimic someone or to allude to social features or values, and 
                taking risks to self-presentation or to social relationships when

                the development of peer humor in children from three to ten we 
                can find the emergence of these features in monolingual and bilingual 
                boys and girls when adults are not participants. Child bilinguals 
                use code switching as a kind of pragmatic marker just as monolinguals 
                use prosodic and lexical discourse markers. In humor, switches 
                have added values for conveying social features, providing a special

              <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
                study demonstrates that the prosody of an obsolescent language, 
                Okinawan, has affected the prosody of the replacing language, 
                Standard Japanese (SJ), resulting in the creation of a new dialect 
                of Japanese. A study of the pitch-accent system of 90 speakers 
                from the Yaeyama area of Okinawa, Japan showed that the number 
                of speakers demonstrating the acquisition of the SJ pitch-accent 
                system increases among the younger speaker cohorts. However, for 
                all age groups the most common prosodic system was a simplified 
                system that eliminated phonological contrast by using a falling 
                pitch (common to both SJ and Okinawan) for every noun class. Surprisingly, 
                although the number of speakers using the simplified system initially 
                showed a decreasing trend, there is a sudden increase in popularity 
                among the youngest speakers, with the simplified system winning 
                out over the SJ system. This increase coincides with changing 
                attitudes towards the Okinawan popular culture among both the 
                Okinawans and the mainland Japanese, suggesting that the new dialect 
                is here to stay. These results open new ground on obsolescent 
                languages, as previous research has overlooked cases where the 
                obsolescent language has a persistent and apparently permanent 
                influence on the replacement language. </font></p>

              <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A 
                lab hour, a major instructional setting of engineering and science 
                departments of many U.S. universities, provides a special conversational 
                event in which nonnative teaching assistants (NNS TAs) teach native 
                English-speaking (NS) students. The NNS TAs are frequently engaged 
                in one-on-one interactions with NS students while answering questions 
                and/or helping to complete projects or assignments. While possessed 
                of better knowledge of content areas, a NNS TA's L2 competence
                hardly reaches the native level. This qualitative study examines
                cases in which NS students opt to directly correct their TA's
                production and input. Specially focused are the questions of how
                NNS TAs coordinate verbal and non-verbal interactional resources
                contingent upon this often-dispreferred interactional behavior
                in the course of meaning negotiation, and more importantly, what
                consequences the participant's actions bring to participant alignment
                and power relationship. From the video-taped data of spontaneous
                one-on-one interactions in which 5 Korean and 4 NS TAs participate,
                this microethnographic study examines sequential organization
                of repair (Schegloff, Jefferson, &amp; Sacks, 1977). </font></p>

              <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><i>So</i>
                has a well-established use as an intensifying adverb modifying
                adjectives (<i>That is so cool!</i>). For some speakers, it is gaining
                the ability to modify verbs (<i>I am so going to flunk this test</i>,
                <i>I so need a nap</i>). Research is needed to determine in what
                order the new structural environments emerge, who the speakers
                adopting the change are, and how social factors influence the
                process. This paper reports on exploratory research in order to
                generate hypotheses for more systematic research. <br>
                Observed use of <i>so</i> shows that it can occur wherever traditional
                verb-modifying intensifying adverbs occur. Naturalness judgment
                data suggest the following patterns to investigate. One way in
                which <i>so</i> begins to spread may be that it remains in position
                after a BE verb, but comes to be viewed as a verb-modifying intensifier,
                so that elements other than adjectives follow (<i>You're so lying
                right now</i>). However, BE followed by <i>so</i> and a noun phrase
                seems to be a later development, as does negation. Modals might
                provide an alternate starting place for the spread of <i>so</i>,
                but auxiliary HAVE followed by <i>so</i> emerges later. Finally,
                findings suggest that speakers do not adopt <i>so</i> structure by
                structure, but by means of specific expressions.</font></p>

                new communication technologies have become increasingly integrated 
                into our everyday lives, researchers have begun to explore the 
                various ways we use these technologies for social interaction. 
                Recently researchers have begun to look beyond the content of 
                online interactions, into the structure of electronic communication, 
                in order to describe how people make sense of conversation in 
                this new medium. One emerging approach to this problem is to employ 
                methods derived from Conversation Analysis. This paper will add 
                to this small but growing line of research by investigating the 
                turn construction process in a computer-mediated chat environment. 
                I analyze and describe the turn construction activities of one 
                member of a team of undergraduate students enrolled in a group 
                communication course. I examine the process she underwent as she 
                followed the conversation and responded to the other members of 
                the team, and decided how to construct each turn and when to hit 
                send, the electronic equivalent of claiming the floor. Using data 
                from a computer screen capture, video recordings of the meeting 
                room, and the proceedings of the chat itself, I will describe 
                how this team member engages in self-repair and turn monitoring 
                by analyzing her editing changes, pauses, and external distractions.

              <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The
                Hebrew word tov is listed in Even-Shoshan's dictionary (1986)
                as an adjective meaning <i>good</i>, as an adverb, a noun, a verb,
                and as a <i>word of agreement and affirmation</i> meaning <i>eyes,
                fine</i>. The present study focuses on this last meaning of tov 
                in Israeli Hebrew casual conversation, as well as on another meaning, 
                not listed in any of the dictionaries. In both of these uses, 
                tov comprises a discourse marker (Maschler 2002). In the corpus 
                examined, 46.7% of tov tokens are employed by the addressee and 
                function in the interpersonal realm as (1) agreement, (2) acceptance, 
                (3) third turn receipt, (4) concession, or (5) ironic agreement, 
                i.e. disagreement; while 38.3% of tov tokens are employed by the 
                speaker and function in the textual realm to mark transitions 
                (1) at beginnings of major narrational or elicitational topics 
                (Chafe 1994), (2) between episodes or sub-episodes of a narrative, 
                (3) returning to an interrupted action, or (4) at the end of a 
                topic/action. Another 15% of the tokens perform both interpersonal 
                and textual functions simultaneously. Those tokens functioning 
                simultaneously in both realms are particularly illuminating for 
                my research on discourse markers, as close examination of the 
                contexts in which they occur suggests how a particular marker 
                might come to serve both interpersonal as well as textual functions. 
                This study, then, explores the functions of tov in Israeli Hebrew 
                casual conversation in order to reveal the functional itinerary 
                followed by this discourse marker, thus contributing to cross-language 
                studies of grammaticization of discourse markers (e.g., Fleischman 
                &amp; Yaguello 1999, Traugott &amp; Dasher 2002). </font></p>

                Between Task and Non-Task Activities at Work</strong></em></font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
                paper examines the collaborative accomplishment of transitions 
                between work and breaks in a small architectural firm, showing 
                that such seemingly unstructured events are in fact subtly organized 
                and socially coordinated. Examination of these moments suggests 
                that taking a break is a social activity, but one that is rarely 
                coordinated explicitly. Rather, employees make their actions visible 
                (and audible) to one another and monitor each other for uptake. 
                In doing so, they make limited use of verbal cues, relying primarily 
                on their bodies and material objects to signal their intentions. 
                I contend that these moments are relevant for the study of professional 
                identity and organizational structure. Through the way that they 
                manage these transitions, architects display their attitudes towards 
                the activities on either side?work and breaks. The ability to 
                do so appropriately is arguably an important element of professional 
                competence. In addition, these moments can constitute sites at 
                which the hierarchy of the organization is enacted: frame-by-frame 
                analysis of one instance shows how the shift to a new activity 
                hinges on actions of the principal architect. This suggests that 
                these junctures can reveal much about the social organization 
                of a workplace and the micro-practices through which it is produced

              <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Recent 
                work in Anthropology has examined the current fascination with 
                <i>biodiversity</i> in both academic and popular discourses (Escobar,
                Brosius 1999, Bamford 2002). These critiques have argued that
                while the term ostensibly describes an objective reality it simultaneously
                constructs the threat to the environment in a particular way,
                prescribing the role that certain actors should play. In the following
                I will argue that when the concept of biodiversity, and the notion
                of ecology it extends to, are brought to bear on the language
                advocacy movement the threat to <i>linguistic diversity</i> is similarly
                constructed in a particular way. Using Williams' (1976) notion
                of a keyword as a site at which the meaning of social experience
                is negotiated and contested, this essay combines both textual
                and visual analysis of the literature on the endangerment of <i>linguistic
                diversity.</i> Specifically, this essay explores the ambiguities
                and contradictions that arise as these environmental discourses 
                are deployed, appropriated and transformed in the literature on 
                language endangerment. </font></p>

              <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                idea that gender is constructed through performance (Butler 1990; 
                West &amp; Zimmerman 1987) has been further developed by work 
                showing that the construction of gender is to a large extent culture-dependent 
                as far as performance of gendered identities is concerned (Ong 
                2001, <i>Feminism and Race</i>). Using linguistic data from khotis, 
                a sexual minority of India, I provide evidence in support of the 
                claim that the verbal construction of gender and sexuality must 
                be understood as specific to Indian culture. I focus on how naming 
                practices, choices of linguistic features and interactional style 
                are involved in the construction of membership in the gendered 
                group referred to as khotis. Using data from my 2003 fieldwork 
                in Lucknow and New Delhi, I show that Farasi plays an important 
                role in the construction of khotis' sexual identity as distinct
                from males, females, gays, and lesbians.<br>
                I also focus on the khotis' practice of referring to themselves
                and one another using the feminine markers. I argue that feminine
                self-reference are used to perform the discourses of powerlessness 
                and submission. My argument is that gender is not only a social 
                construct but it is also a culture dependent social construct.

                <em><strong>From Persuasion to Self-Transformation: Interpersonal 
                Genres of Narration in a Tourist Speech Community </strong></em></font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
                this talk I explore how tourists travel-narratives performatively 
                implicate their audience in their taleworlds vis-a-vis persuading 
                them to travel and establishing an experience of self-transformation. 
                The implication is discursively achieved vis-a-vis the creation 
                of a dialogical-intersubjective realm wherein the narrators' 
                identity claims are persuasively performed, and into which the 
                audience is drawn. Through listening to their stories, it is argued, 
                the audience partakes in a practice which is part and parcel of 
                the constitutive rituals that are at the core of the speech community. 
                Storytelling, and storyhearing, are not a byproduct of the adventurous 
                travel, then, but rather share the same ritualistic realm of eventful 
                practices, in which the trip is also a narrative event. Through 
                this fusion of narrated events with the event of narration, between 
                referential and performative communicative capacities, conversational 
                storytelling creates a profoundly eventful impression. In it the 
                interviewer-audience is positioned as a novice who seeks knowledge, 
                and the conversation is constructed as the commencement of her 
                or his own process of self-transformation. Enacted dialogically, 
                persuasion and self-transformation genres show how personal narratives 
                are interpersonally co-produced, and how an intersubjective realm 
                of experience is linguistically created within the narration performance.

                  <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
                    paper applies methods of interactional analysis to the video 
                    recording of a musical performance in Fez, Morocco, with the 
                    understanding that performance is most essentially a communicative 
                    phenomenon (Bauman 1984). Music and interaction has been approached 
                    in Monson's groundbreaking work (1996); nevertheless, much
                    of her analysis is restricted to social context at the expense
                    of sequential context, particularly the openings and closings
                    that are so ripe for analysis. Here, I am interested in ways
                    hierarchies and power relations (Keating 1995) are imposed,
                    reinforced, and challenged within the frame of the musical
                    performance. I focus on relevant <i>participatory discrepancies,</i>
                    slightly off-tempo rhythms that serve to communicate with
                    other players (Keil 1995), as the specific places at which
                    participants initiate openings, closings, or repair. Since
                    no voices can be discerned on the video recording, I restrict
                    my analysis to gesture and adapt Goodwin's (1986) method
                    for distinguishing relevant gestures. The video documents
                    a performance given by Gnawa musicians in Fez in July 2001.
                    The troupe of five musicians is led by the m'eallim, a teacher
                    and leader who directs this tourist performance, although
                    in another context he is a facilitator of all-night medico-religious
                    therapeutic gatherings. Tentatively, I conclude that interactional
                    analysis shows evidence of particular regimes of power in 
                    communication. </font></p>

                    it is no news that humans are members of many categories, 
                    the consequences of this fact for social scientists have not 
                    been adequately addressed. One of the consequence appears 
                    to be this: that some person is in fact a member of some category 
                    (such as male or elderly) is by itself not an adequate warrant 
                    for so referring to them, for they are always also in fact 
                    a member of some other category as well. Something else has 
                    made the particular formulation that is employed relevant.
                    This is so both for parties to ordinary interaction and for 
                    the investigators who study it. Some investigators have resisted 
                    the challenge by claiming that it virtually requires that 
                    interactional participants enunciate the categories to which 
                    they are oriented in their speaking. But no such insistence 
                    is in fact entailed by the stance sketched above. In this

                    warrant their use of categorical terminology in analyzing 
                    talk-in-interaction by grounding it in the demonstrable indigenous 
                    orientations of the participants in the interaction being 
                    analyzed. Not only will the equivocality of the current analytic 
                    practice of formulating the participants be circumvented; 
                    the analysis itself can be enriched. </font></p>

                    the academic speech of women and men of various academic disciplines 
                    in the lecture and seminar context. Contradictory findings 
                    on male and female communicative behavior in academia warrant 
                    a more refined investigation of the nature of academic speech 
                    and the way various academic contexts and conversational roles 
                    influence the use of question tags and discourse markers. 
                    I propose that not one single factor - e.g. gender or power 
                    - but rather a constellation of the following factors is responsible 
                    for the use of these structures: 1) conversational tasks in 
                    different academic disciplines, 2) gender, 3) power and conversational 
                    roles, (4) context, and 5) educational level. The data for 
                    this project is drawn from the MICASE corpus on academic speech 
                    compiled at the University of Michigan. My data suggest that 
                    among instructors the structures under investigation vary 
                    by discipline but not gender. However, in the less powerful 
                    conversational role of student, gender variation can be found 
                    in the seminar context in all academic disciplines. </font></p>

                    hearing Children of Deaf Adults (codas) represent an interesting 
                    contradiction within the Deaf community. They often possess 
                    close ties to and extensive cultural knowledge of that community 
                    but are physically and experientially separated from it. This 
                    paper focuses on the narratives of four codas in an effort 
                    to uncover how Deaf ideologies shape coda identity. Coda participation 
                    in the Deaf community is simultaneously legitimated and policed; 
                    their blood relationship to Deaf people and ability to sign 
                    are keys to acceptance within that community but they are 
                    never fully accepted as members through active marginalization 
                    and exclusion from Deaf institutions and activities. Furthermore, 
                    complex ideological rules govern coda behavior within the 
                    Deaf community. For example, they must disclose that they 
                    are hearing with any Deaf interlocutor. Such an ideology serves 
                    the purpose of keeping power and linguistic authority in the 
                    hands of Deaf people, highlighting the importance of issues 
                    of linguistic ownership and self-determination to the Deaf 
                    community. Thus, even though Deaf people most often base their 
                    identities on a cultural or gemich view of themselves, the
                    outsider, medicalized view of their physical condition eschewed
                    by most Deaf people is used as justification for exclusion
                    from the community. </font></p>

                    embodied interaction has by and large avoided public figures 
                    as objects of study. However, this year's democratic presidential 
                    campaign with its focus on &quot;electability&quot;, and specifically 
                    the rapid demise of the Dean campaign, suggest that public

                    on Howard Dean and George W. Bush, and discusses what we can

                    day. Mothers, meanwhile, set their husbands up in the role
                    of evaluator, and in the end often became targets of their
                    husband's commentary. In this talk I intend to discuss my
                    study, which takes a new look at the gendered nature of these
                    power dynamics by examining the conversations of seven lesbian
                    couples with children. In most of the families, the type of
                    hierarchical power structure seen by Ochs and Taylor is in
                    place. I show that the use of negative evaluations in this
                    setting, therefore, is not necessarily a gendered power tactic.
                    The findings from the study confound the gendered divisions
                    that Ochs and Taylor saw because here women are acting in 
                    a variety of more and less powerful roles. The conclusions 
                    of the study can help us continue the discussion of the nature 
                    of gender construction in speech, and how using these powerful 
                    speech forms might allow women to <i>"defy, subvert or deliberately
                    seek to redefine gender norms."</i> (Cameron, in Bergvall, et
                    al. 1996:46) </font></p>

                    on interviews and participant-observation, this paper explores 
                    how gay rights activists in Hong Kong adopt two linguistic 
                    strategies to underscore the cultural authenticity of same-sex 
                    desire in Chinese societies. One strategy is the appropriation 
                    of Chinese revolutionary discourse, a prime example of which 
                    is activists' use of tongzhi 'comrade' to refer to sexual
                    minorities. A common address term among Chinese revolutionaries, 
                    tongzhi was appropriated by gay rights activists in the late 
                    1980s. Drawing on its discursive history, activists use tongzhi 
                    to present a public, collective and political front. The use 
                    of tongzhi is also a symbolic gesture against Western gay 
                    ideologies; it underscores the differences between the home-grown
                    gay movement and gay movements in the West. The appropriation 
                    of stories about Chinese historical figures is another common 
                    strategy. By locating same-sex desire in China's past, activists
                    argue that it is indigenous to Chinese culture. This strategy
                    is a necessary step toward constructing a meta-narrative which 
                    provides the raison d'etre of the tongzhi movement. I suggest
                    that rather than take authenticity as a given, researchers 
                    should investigate how it is created through language and 
                    other symbolic resources. </font></p>

                    socializes children into institutional and academic practices. 
                    Because socialization occurs over time, it cannot be analyzed 
                    simply by describing typical speech events that occur in school. 
                    In addition, we must analyze trajectories of events across 
                    which schoolchildren become different kinds of people. This 
                    paper analyzes the social identification that occurred in 
                    one ninth grade U.S. high school English and history classroom 
                    over an academic year, tracing events across which one student 
                    developed a distinctive social identity. The analysis attends 
                    to more widely circulating categories and practices, but also 
                    describes how these were contextualized and sometimes transformed 
                    both in the local classroom ecology and in particular events. 
                    The paper first describes a robust local model of gender identity, 
                    through which teachers and students identified the girls as 
                    academically promising and the boys as academically unpromising. 
                    It illustrates this model by showing how the prototypical 
                    boy was identified across the year. Then the paper describes 
                    the transformation of a normal promising girl into an atypical, 
                    unpromising girl over several months in the middle of the 
                    academic year. The analyses follow this girl through many 
                    speech events across these months, tracing how her classroom 
                    identity changed. These analyses show how an account of socialization 
                    must move beyond typical speech events to trajectories of 
                    events across timescales. </font></p>
