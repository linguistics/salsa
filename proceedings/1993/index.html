          Spanish" is a mini-register used by speakers of English in the U.S. 
          that attracts lexical items and fixed expressions of Spanish-language 
          origin. The incorporation strategies of Junk Spanish lower material 
          that has positive or neutral meanings in Spanish itself to a jocular 
          or pejorative English meaning. Spanish-language elements of negative 
          or scatological meaning are especially likely to appear in this register. 
          Junk Spanish is common in mass media where it is often associated with 
          stereotyped racist representations of "Mexicans." It is argued that 
          Junk Spanish is an important strategy of Anglo racism that has intensified 
          in an atmosphere where more overt racist epithets and joking have been 
          forced underground. </font>

          paper explores the collisions and merging of speech genres in discourse 
          about unidentified flying objects. Through a close reading of a single 
          conversation among UFO believers. I analyze how textual authority is 
          negotiated through the deployment of speech styles. I show how a multiplicity 
          of voices opens an unfinalized space for the narration of an uncanny 
          experience. Finally, I connect this brief conversation to larger cultural 
          tensions surrounding science, gender and authority. </font>

          story] is one of the oldest forms of communication. It does not aim 
          at transmitting the pure-in-itself of the event (as information does) 
          but anchors the event in the life of the person reporting, in order 
          to pass it on as experience to those listening. (Benjamin, 1972 [Vol. 
          1]:611; translated in Buck-Morse, 1989:336). </font>

          <i>Mary Bucholtz, University of California, Berkeley</i><br>
          </font></h4>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Despite 
          the great deal of recent attention that discourse analysts have given 
          to language and the law, the use of transcriptions of translated speech 
          as evidence in the courtroom is an issue that has gone undiscussed by 
          linguists. This topic brings together three important factors addressed 
          by various researchers on legal language: the courtroom context, the 
          use of spoken and written language as evidence, and the effect of minority 
          languages on trial proceedings. Taking as data the written translation 
          of a telephone conversation used as evidence in a federal trial, I show 
          that recontextualization of the conversation, disjunctions in the written 
          transcription of speech, and pragmatic inconsistencies in translation 
          can lead to juror bias against the defendant. Courtroom transcription 
          is therefore a significant site for the contributions of discourse analysis.

        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Some 
          previous sociolinguistic studies of directives in natural speech samples 
          have conveyed the impression that a directive is a concrete, countable 
          phenomenon, fairly easily recognized and usually complete in a single 
          utterance. Using excerpts of the talk between gynecologists and their 
          female patients, tape recorded during office visits, the present study 
          demonstrates that a single directive intent may be conveyed by a series 
          of utterances and that a single utterance may serve more than one function. 
          The repercussions from these nontrivial observations attempts to quantify 
          the directives in natural speech, specifically in doctor-patient talk, 
          are examined. </font>

        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
          this paper, we attempt to explain the generational differences in the 
          English phonology of Japanese-Americans. We believe that these speech 
          differences are linked to changes in identity and social networks brought 
          about by the events which took place in the United States during the 
          Second World War. The internment of thousands of Japanese-Americans 
          in concentration camps drastically affected individuals by breaking 
          up their social networks, and permanently affected their community and 
          its relation to the larger society. We have collected data on the phonological 
          processes of t/d deletion and monophthongization of/ey/ and /ow/ from 
          recorded interviews with Japanese-Americans of the second and fourth 
          generations. Investigation of generational differences with respect 
          to these processes suggests that the English spoken by second generation 
          nisei bilingual speakers exhibits retention of features from the substrate 
          (Japanese) language. The speech of the fourth generation yonsei speakers, 
          however, has clearly converged with that of the matrix dialect. We attribute 
          this generational divergence to the dramatic change in the identity 
          and social networks of the Japanese-American community. </font>

          relationship between language and ethnicity in Ukraine is examined, 
          based on data gathered during fieldwork conducted from October 1991 
          through August 1992. A model of diglossia is used to elucidate the change 
          roles of language which have been a focal point of political transformations. 
          Until recently, Russian was the H(igh) language, and Ukrainian the L(ow), 
          but data show that diglossia in Ukraine is now shifting to include both 
          standard Russian and standard Ukrainian as H languages. The L language 
          slot is now filled by all non-standard dialects and mixtures of Ukrainian 
          and Russian, which are collectively denoted by the Ukrainian term "surzhyk". 
          People living in Ukraine have developed various strategies to deal with 
          this flux in the linguistic structure of their world. Several ethnographic 
          cases are examined in depth, with reference to Giles' speech accommodation 
          theory to analyze the choices people make between languages and language 
          variants in given contexts. Some of the conflicts created by the shifting 
          diglossia, and their resolutions, are discussed. </font>

          the social meaning of its use. Parallels are drawn between language 
          choice (Arabic/Hebrew) and the choice of dialect within Hebrew, the 
          politically charged dominant language in Israel. The social meaning 
          of this emergent language-use cannot be understood without reference 
          to a complex web of inter-relations between Palestinian Arabs, Mizrahi-

          of new social identities, and where it is this very negotiation which

          Defense of the Proposition, "When a Language Dies, a Culture Dies"<br>
          <i>Anthony C. Woodbury, University of Texas, Austin</i><br>
          </font></h4>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
          proposition "When a language dies, a culture dies" gives a reason for 
          preserving endangered languages, but raises valid questions in light 
          of recent work on multilingual communities and on the conservatism of 
          some aspects of language use in situations of language shift. It is 
          claimed that these objections are met if the proposition is revised 
          to say that interrupted transmission of an integrated lexical and grammatical 
          heritage spells the direct end of some cultural traditions, and the 
          unraveling, restructuring, and reevaluation of others. In support of 
          this, it is argued that in situations of language shift, ancestral and 
          replacing languages are not equivalent vehicles for cultural maintenance 
          or expression. An extended empirical case is made on the basis of Central 
          Alaskan Yupik Eskimo demonstrative use. </font>

        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Studies 
          of language maintenance or shift deal with situations in which the language 
          enduring either of these processes is of a lower prestige. The immigrant 
          community I have studied poses a unique perspective: that of English, 
          a language of great instrumental value in the business community that 
          is currently confronting the same shift and maintenance dilemma typical 
          of other immigrant languages, the loss of the home domain. In field 
          work carried out in Buenos Aires, Argentina in 1990, I had Anglo-Argentine 
          community members answer extensive questionnaires concerning language 
          use and language attitudes to both Spanish and English. Factor analysis 
          and relative frequencies show that in spite of its prestige, English 
          is no longer maintained at home. Further statistical analyses show that 
          the main demographic factor affecting change is age, with younger members 
          less likely to speak English than older ones. Although the English language 
          is maintained in the schools, personal accounts and participant observations 
          of community members show that the language is not an ethnic marker. 
          The fact that English has lost its value as an ethnic marker can account 
          for the loss of the home domain. There is a tendency in sociolinguistics 
          to believe that the problems of language maintenance are usually related 
          to the lower prestige and economic standing of the community speaking 
          the immigrant language. This study maintains that there are covert forces 
          at work in the community at large that put into question the loyalty 
          of an immigrant community and makes it very difficult to maintain a 
          situation of stable bilingualism if isolation is not achieved. </font>

          of language prestige and female employment opportunities. Higher rates 
          of male proficiency were evident only in the most rural location; thus, 
          data was gathered in threemore rural communities in order to substantiate 
          the original findings. An additional 148 subjects were measured, and 
          the results of the first study were verified. Overall, the correlative 
          factors in language retention by males include rurality, early stages 
          of language shift, low socioeconomic status, and employment patterns.

          this paper, I propose that dying languages are characterized by a stage 
          of structure exaggeration, in which features of the dying language most 
          saliently different from the dominant are used more frequently and in 
          more situations than in the earlier, healthy form of the language. I 
          first base my observations on research conducted on a dying dialect

          Roles and Participant Introductions in Native English and Second Language 
          Discourse<br>

        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
          study is concerned with the way in which new participants are introduced 
          into a narrative. It examines the form of the noun phrase introducing 
          the referent, and correlates that with the grammatical role of the NP 
          and with the status of the character (major or minor) in the narrative. 
          Both native and nonnative English texts will be examined. It is assumed 
          that the form of the NP is based largely on factors of information flow, 
          that is, on whether information is new to the discourse or to the hearer, 
          known to the hearer, accessible through some sort of shared knowledge, 
          evoked by a frame, and so on; the information status of some NPs will 
          be discussed. The perspective supporting this study is that grammatical 
          structures emerge from patterns of language use: grammar may take shape 
          to a significant degree as a result of discourse patterns which one 
          can understand as functionally or pragmatically driven. Du Bois' (1987) 
          discussion of the role of intransitives in narratives particularly motivates 
          this work. (See also Chafe, 1980, 1987; Prince, 1981, 1992; Du Bois, 
          1980; and Givon, 1983). Introductions are identified and classified 
          in this study according to the structure of the clause containing the 
          first mention of, or the first reference to, the new participant. As 
          such, the NPs used to refer to these participants will be new information, 
          and it is expected that the NPs will be full lexical nouns. Du Bois 
          (1987) and others have quantified the expectation that new information 
          correlates with full NPs. This study will review and revise the claim 
          (Du Bois, 1987; Redeker, 1987) that new participants are introduced 
          with intransitives. </font>

          <i>Cynthia Dickel Dunn, University of Texas, Austin</i><br>
          </font></h4>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
          paper uses data from interviews with twelve native speakers of Japanese 
          to discuss the issue of what happens when people with different sociolinguistic 
          norms for honorific use meet and try to converse. The consultants were 
          asked about their norms for the use of Japanese honorific levels and 
          to describe situations in which they were surprised by someone else's 
          honorific use. Several consultants described situations in which they 
          were uncomfortable because their interlocutors used plain forms when 
          they expected polite honorifics, or vice versa. There were also instances 
          in which one speaker changed his/her behavior to match that of the other. 
          Diverging expectations about appropriate honorific use can thus lead 
          to negative emotional reactions, accommodation, or both. The negotiation 
          of which honorific level to use involves both defining the nature of 
          the relationship and reaching a level of accommodation between potentially 
          disparate sociolinguistic norms. </font>

        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Disagreement 
          has previously been considered a structurally and consequently an interactionally 
          'dispreferred' action that threatens speakers' sociability. No study 
          has thoroughly examined contextual factors that may reflect a particular 
          form a disagreement make take, but some studies have shown that disagreement 
          can be a form of sociability in some ethnic groups (Schiffrin 1984, 
          Kakava 1989). The purpose of this study is to examine a type of disagreement 
          referred to as 'aggravated correction' and show that this type of disagreement 
          can reflect contextual parameters such as speakers' high involvement 
          style (Tannen 1984) and a speech community's cultural norms which may 
          'allow' this type of contentiousness. It further proposes a modified 
          version of Hymes' (1972) speech components as the likely parameters 
          that may be indexed by a particular disagreement type. This study treats 
          disagreement as a context-dependent action in a constitutive relationship 
          with contextual parameters and it thus redresses previous studies' limitations.

          writers have explained the Southern Athapaskan (Apachean) clan system 
          as either a result of Pueblo influence, or as an epiphenomenon of material 
          subsistence patterns. The present paper instead investigates Apachean 
          clanship and kinship as an expressive system--that is, as a primary 
          speech genre in an ethnography of speaking. The paper delineates the 
          use of kinship terms as an extended set of personal pronouns. It explores 
          the ways in which this personal pronoun usage constitutes sentiment 
          and social relations in a system of competitive egalitarianism. A connection 
          between grammar and this intersubjective sentiment is made in a discussion 
          of the proper use of the dual form of the verb.<br>

        <p align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
          paper examines the extent to which verbal expressive roles played by 
          the female and male in Akan culture correspond to the socially approved 
          sex-roles. It is hypothesized that sex-exclusive verbal genres will 
          mirror the general sex roles, if society is consistent in allocating 
          roles. To explore this issue, the contexts of performance and functions 
          of four female and five male verbal activities and genres are described 
          and compared to the Akan's conception of masculinity and femininity 
          and sex roles. The analysis suggests that just as males dominate public 
          activities, and women take charge of domestic ones, discourse types 
          controlled by the sexes also follow similar patterns. The paper, however, 
          goes beyond simple correlation to examine the associations that has 
          been made between the domestic realm and powerlessness on one hand, 
          and the public sphere and power on the other. It observes that the opposition 
          between the two domains as well as the differential values associated 
          with them derive from capitalist ideologies, and may not apply to every 
          society. The paper concludes that disparate criteria may be necessary 
          in assessing gender hierarchy and relations in different cultures. </font>

          language by these Sherpa and Tamang villagers. Nepali is the language 
          of the high-caste Hindu majority in Nepal, of the central government 
          and all its bureaucratic processes, of school instruction, and of radio 
          news and folksong broadcasts. When speaking Nepali, these Sherpa and

          changes that are perceived as mistakes by the high-caste majority. These
