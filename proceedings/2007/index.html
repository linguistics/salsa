  John Heritage&#9474;University of California, Los Angeles </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Much work within linguistics and conversation analysis has been devoted to  examining how shared knowledge and mutual understanding are managed.&nbsp; Much less effort has been focused on how the  sharing of personal experience is managed as an interactional process. Yet this  kind of sharing involves some of the most intimate forms of mutuality between  persons, and may be central in the formation and management of social  bonds.&nbsp; This paper offers a sketch of  some of the ways in which recipients of talk about personal experiences can  manage (or fail to manage) moments of empathic connection with their  interlocutors.</font></p>

  Judith T. Irvine&#9474;  University of Michigan </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This paper  explores some problems of consistency and disjuncture in ideologies of language  and the (socio-)linguistic experiences in which those ideologies are embedded.  In what arenas might one look for consistency? What are some kinds of  disjuncture, and what social, ideological, and/or analytical work might they  set in motion? To speak of &ldquo;ideology&rdquo; at all is to imply a lack of fit between  whatever one is calling &ldquo;ideology&rdquo; or &ldquo;ideologized&rdquo; and some other aspect of  the world we live in. The paper considers six sets of examples, some from the  sociolinguistic literature and some from my own (mostly Africanist) research,  to explore relationships among experience, ideology, and analysis. Finally, if  time permits, I will look at some material from an ongoing project with  Senegalese migrants in Michigan,  to ask whether an ideological principle itself can contain a logical  contradiction.</font></p>

  Barbara  Johnstone&#9474;Carnegie Mellon University </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A Pittsburgher  who left the city in the mid-1960s and returned after 2000 encountered a very  different indexical soundscape than the one she left.&nbsp; Before about 1967, features like  /aw/-monophthongization (which makes <em>downtown</em> sound like <em>dahntahn</em>) indexed social  class, for those Pittsburghers for whom this variant had any second-order  indexical meaning at all.&nbsp; Growing up in  a middle-class suburb, the returned Pittsburgher associated this and other  local features with the nearest working-class neighborhood, and many of the  relatively socially and geographically immobile residents of that neighborhood  didn&rsquo;t associate them with anything.&nbsp;  Coming back to Pittsburgh  in 2004, the returnee found that people now associated the same features not  with class but with place.&nbsp; Features  people heard as local were now collectively referred to as &ldquo;Pittsburghese,&rdquo; a  term she&rsquo;d never heard as a child, and examples of&nbsp; &ldquo;Pittsburghese&rdquo; adorned coffee mugs,  t-shirts, postcards, and refrigerator magnets, and even got spoken by a talking  doll.&nbsp; Newspaper cartoonists and  columnists alluded to &ldquo;Pittsburghese&rdquo; almost every time they alluded to local  identity, and ordinary people talked about local speech with a new sense of  pride.&nbsp; Yet you could still hear people  speaking with the local accent -- she did so herself, she thought -- and some  of these people found it embarrassing.<br>
          <br>
          In this paper, I  trace the historical developments during the latter half of the 20th  century and the beginning of the 21st that have given rise to these  ways of imagining and re-imagining local speech forms in Pittsburgh.&nbsp; I draw on Michael Silverstein&rsquo;s concept of  indexical order to trace how variables like monophthongal /aw/ that once just  correlated with local birth or residence came to serve as second-order indices  of class and correctness in everyday linguistic practice, and how a subset of  these features have come to index place in a highly reflexive,  representational, third-order way.&nbsp; I pay  particular attention to the layering of these three orders of indexicality in  the sociolinguistic environment of Pittsburghers like the returnee: people who  both talk in and talk about Pittsburgh  dialect.&nbsp; I ask how they make sense of  the various meanings the same feature can carry depending on the activity one  is engaged in. Finally, I link the process I have described with William  Labov&rsquo;s notion of sociolinguistic &ldquo;stereotyping,&rdquo; exploring how the idea of  indexical layering might work to explain why and how stereotypes arise and why  stereotyped forms typically disappear from everyday speech over time.&nbsp; <br>

  Carol Padden&#9474;University of California, San    Diego </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is well-known  that diversity of spoken languages around the world is not equally distributed  (Nettle &amp; Romaine, 2000). Highly diverse areas where many languages  co-exist are concentrated in a few places in the world, in contrast to most of  Europe and North America where diversity is  comparatively much lower. Because of the social history of communities of deaf  people around the world, the geography of sign languages does not pattern like  spoken languages. British Sign Language, for example, is not related to  American Sign Language; instead, ASL is related to French Sign Language because  ties between their deaf education systems. BSL, on the other hand, is closely  related to Australian Sign Language and New Zealand Sign Language because of  the influence of British deaf educators dating from the middle of the  nineteenth century. In this talk, I will contrast sign languages of Europe and  North America on the one hand with sign languages of the Middle   East on the other.&nbsp; In  Europe and North America, communities of deaf  people are in large part shaped by the systems of deaf education built in the  late eighteenth and early nineteenth century. In the Middle   East, however, deaf education has a different history. As a  result, we see a distinctly different distribution of sign languages in this  region, with more unrelated sign languages. Many, though not all, of these sign  languages are small and generally, are younger languages, having existed for  only a few generations. </font></p>

  Janet  Ainsworth&#9474;Seattle  University</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Criminal  suspects have the right to assistance of counsel when they are subjected to  custodial police interrogation because of its inherent coerciveness. Under  Supreme Court caselaw, a suspect is deemed to have invoked this right to  counsel only if the request is clear and unhedged. This paper challenges this  doctrine as an inadequate protection of constitutional rights, based on false  assumptions about conversational implicature. It also flies in the face of  sociolinguistic research on the use of hedged and indirect speech patterns  showing that those in positions of powerlessness&mdash;women, minorities, and indeed  criminal suspects generally&mdash;are apt to use indirect and qualified modes of  performative speech. Legal rules privileging direct, assertive speech thus lead  courts to ignore attempts by large segments of the population to exercise their  constitutional rights. Understanding the sociolinguistic and pragmatic factors  that lead persons to choose a particular mode of speech would require courts to  treat indirect, facially ambiguous requests for counsel as effective  invocations of that right.</font></p>

  Jennifer  Andrus&#9474;Carnegie  Mellon University</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In  this paper, I analyze the metadiscursive construction of discursive agency in  legal appeals based on the &ldquo;excited utterance&rdquo; exception to the hearsay rule of  evidence in US  case law. The excited utterance is a statement made in response to a startling  event that has stilled the reflective faculties of the speaker (Federal Rules  of Evidence, VIII.3). The discourse regarding the admissibility of the excited  utterance reproduces and circulates a language ideology that sometimes assigns  discursive agency, or what Blommaert (2005) refers to as &ldquo;voice,&rdquo; &nbsp;to  events rather than speakers. Based on a corpus analysis of 84 appellate court opinions,  I argue that the testimonial/nontestimonial binary operating in the excited  utterance exception to hearsay limits the performative agency (Duranti, 2001)  of victims and witnesses and creates a situation in which accurate statements  about an event can only be produced by the event itself. This analysis also  complicates the sometimes oversimplified Western views about discourse and  agency that locate agency in either the speaker or the institution.</font></p>

  Brahim Chakrani&#9474;University  of Illinois at Urbana  Champaign </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Much  of the attention allotted to the notion of context within the Speech Act Theory  (SAT) has been focused on conventional elements of context, in the form of  felicity conditions, which help the speaker attain a successful performance of  speech utterances. &nbsp;However, a major criticism directed towards the  theoretical premise of SAT lies in its failure to consider &ldquo;cultural context&rdquo;  as a determining factor in signaling the reading of speech utterances and their  performative nature (Leech, 1983). &nbsp;Using Moroccan bargaining data, this  paper investigates the importance of cultural context in the determination of  the illocutionary force and the perlocutionary effects of speech utterances in  the bargaining exchange. The theoretical focus of this paper is to show how  marketers in a bargaining exchange manipulate salient shared cultural concepts  and strategically organize and analyze each other&rsquo;s locutions while mobilizing  the different social roles and indexing the relationships in which they enter.  &nbsp;</font></p>

  Louis Chen&#9474;OISE/University of Toronto </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This  case study is part of a Canada-wide multiliteracy research project that  explores ways of promoting collaborative critical inquiry through an instant  messaging (IM) software. Central to this presentation is a focus on how  students in a grade 10 Math class collectively made efficient use of this  popular technology to create optimal learning conditions. In this presentation  I will provide a detail account of how students utilized the structure of online  communicative processes to actively control their learning, develop their  understanding of mathematical concepts and shape </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">their  social identity.

        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><a name="clark"></a>Signs  of Change: Navigating the Conflicts Between African American and Deaf Cultural  Identities</strong><br>
  Heather  Clark&#9474;University  of Washington</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">African  Americans traditionally use verbal language as a way not only to communicate  but also as a way to share stories of love, survival, struggle and triumph.  &nbsp;However, research on African American communication has ignored a  sub-section of the larger community: individuals who are Deaf.<br>
          <br>
          The Deaf community also has a strong affinity to its unique language and its  use to transmit cultural identity information, American Sign Language is  recognized as the cultural language of the Deaf community. <br>
          This paper will explore how individuals who are both African American and Deaf  navigate between the two modes of cultural communication. &nbsp;Is one language  and identity prioritized over the other and for what reason, and in what  contexts?<br>
          <br>
          Research on the African American and Deaf communities has had virtually no  intersection. &nbsp;My goal is to bridge this gap to find ways in which the  African American Deaf individual may be able to have a positive impact on  transforming the many communities she belongs to.<br>

          <strong><a name="fitzpatrick"></a>Analyzing  Hip Hop Discourse as a Locus of 'Men's Language'</strong><br>
        Jim  Fitzpatrick&#9474;North  Carolina State University</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In  this paper, I examine contemporary hip hop lyrics, largely taken from rap  battles, in order to demonstrate that gender and sexuality are strongly  connected to social status in the hip hop community. &nbsp;Central to this  argument is the idea that social activity in African American communities is  governed by a &ldquo;code of the street&rdquo;, which centers around the commodification of  respect, or being granted one's social due. &nbsp;Hip hop lyrics are rife with  examples of so-called 'men's language', which as Robin Lakoff has suggested,  must be analyzed concurrently with 'women's language'. &nbsp;An analysis of the  language (mostly male) rappers use to negotiate social status offers insight  into the value system of the status economy by showing how men use gendered  language to place others into lower-status positions. &nbsp;However, the social  status afforded by the use of 'men's language' is limited in scope due to the  socioeconomic realities of inner-city life. &nbsp;Thus, we must reconsider the  widely-held perception that 'men's language' affords far-reaching benefits to those  who use it.<br>

  Cecilia Genuino&#9474;De La Salle  University </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The  study investigated the status of Chabacano (Philippine Spanish Creole) in five  archipelagic areas of the Philippines  (Zamboanga, Ternate, Cavite City, Ermita and Davao)were it is or it was once the  vernacular. As a sociolinguistic study, language choice was determined through  participant observation, survey, in-depth interview and dyadic recording.  Results revealed that Chabacano is surviving but threatened in Zamboanga, dying  in Ternate and Cavite City, and dead in Davao and Ermita. Age and role-relationship  motivated the speakers in their choice of language while topic and place were  non-motivating factors. <br>
          <br>
          The factors that led the language to its current status were migration,  intermarriages, limited domains of language use, bilingual education policy,  implementation of Filipino as a national language, location, language attitude  and language prestige.<br>
          <br>
          The stand of the paper is that Chabacano is not yet dead but it needs immediate  attention because it is in the process of extinction.</font></p>

I argue that  mainstream Catholics&rsquo; linguistic practices (e.g. purist uses of Q&rsquo;eqchi&rsquo;, a  restricted number of ratified speakers, conventional texts, etc.) are connected  to ideas about self-control and the mediation of religious experience through  the local community and the Church hierarchy. Charismatic Catholics&rsquo; practices  (e.g. code switching between Spanish and Q&rsquo;eqchi&rsquo;, glossolalia, etc.), on the  other hand, derive from ideas about individual spontaneity and a desire for an  unmediated experience of the divine. These differences have recently become the  focus of a debate about what it means to be a good Q&rsquo;eqchi&rsquo;-Maya Catholic. I  will argue that in order to understand what is at stake in this debate over  linguistic practices we must consider how each group&rsquo;s&nbsp;the theological  concerns and goals engender two opposing language ideological positions.<br>

  Chun  Huang&#9474;University  of Florida<br>
  <br>
  I propose a &ldquo;critical&rdquo; approach to language planning (LP) for naming that  incorporates broad sociopolitical context. An approach as such investigates the  ideology, myths, and coercion behind LP that affect every aspect of social  life. I carry out a historical perspective as my analytical methodology.<br>
  <br>
  I compare two sets of LP that have taken place in Taiwan: one is Chinese-centric,  implemented by the nationalist KMT government between 1945 and 1999, and the  other by the localist DPP government since 2000. I examine the naming practices  along two social domains: the public and the private. In the public domain, I  inspect the &ldquo;linguistic landscape&rdquo; created by the LP and their effects on  people&rsquo;s mental landscape. In the private domain, I examine how LP concerning  personal names has a consequence in people&rsquo;s perception of self and their  culture. My discussion includes the policy, the implementation of it, and the  associated social discourse. As a whole, I indicate that LP for naming and  people&rsquo;s identification process mutually construct with each other.</font></p>

  Aya  Inoue &amp; Andrew Wong&#9474;University of Hawaii  at Manoa</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Several  studies have explored ideologies about Pidgin (or Hawai&lsquo;i Creole English)  through surveys and questionnaires. Language ideology, however, is only partly  captured in self-reports: people&rsquo;s talk about language is often less nuanced  than their practical understandings manifest in language use. Focusing on  translation jokes circulated in print and electronic media, this study goes  beyond self-reports to investigate ideologies about Pidgin embedded in language  use. Translation jokes, which often rely on stereotypes for creating humor,  serve as an ideal site for the investigation of ideology. In Pidgin-English  translation jokes, a Pidgin and an English text are juxtaposed against each  other. While the core meaning of the texts is kept roughly the same, the  intertextual gap is manipulated for comic effect. In our corpus of translation  jokes, Pidgin and English represent &lsquo;local voice&rsquo; and &lsquo;haole (i.e., white)  voice&rsquo; respectively. To uncover ideologies about Pidgin and English, this study  examines the linguistic construction of the two voices in translation humor.  &nbsp;</font></p>

  Kobin  Kendrick&#9474;University  of California,  Santa Barbara</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Recent  conversation analytic research on language and sexually has taken an  empirically grounded approach to the study of sexuality in everyday  interaction. &nbsp;This work seeks to uncover the routine interactional  practices through which speakers produce themselves as either heterosexual or  homosexual. These practices, accomplished jointly by co-participants in interaction,  may work either to disrupt or to maintain normative sexual identities and  ideologies. &nbsp;This paper analyzes extracts from two conversations in which  self-identified gay men account for apparently non-normative conduct, in one  case a past sexual experience with a women and in another a lack of sex with a  long-term partner. The analysis focuses both on the practices that the men use  to account for these experiences as well as the methods that co-participants  use to make such accounts relevant in the interaction. &nbsp;It is argued that  these account sequences reveal participants' conceptions of normative and  non-normative conduct for gay men and simultaneously serve to maintain  normative gay identities.<br>

        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Scholars  from various disciplinary backgrounds have studied advertising language in  terms of persuasive strategies, the message content, and the ideology of the  consumer culture, but there has been a lack of linguistic research on the  discourse variation among advertisements that promote particular commodities or  target different social groups. This study attempts to fill this gap by  providing a sociolinguistic analysis of print advertising and explores the  notion that there are two main persuasive tactics in advertising discourse:  reason or hard-sell advertising and tickle or soft-sell advertising. The data  for this study consist of print advertisements collected from one year&rsquo;s issues  of 3 magazines that differ in terms of the targeted readership. A total of 252  unique advertisements representing 3 different types of commodities are  collected and analyzed for discourse patterns. Results suggest that differences  in the persuasive strategies used in advertising correlate with both target  audience and commodity type. </font></p>

        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">American  Russian (AR), a reduced variety of Russian spoken in the United States, is generally  characterized as exhibiting significant lexical and structural changes as  compared to Standard Russian. The study examines the attrition phenomena in the  original data elicited from AR speakers in Minnesota, focusing on the reduction of  vocabulary, lexicalization and loss of aspectual distinctions, loss of gender  agreement and case. The findings presented in the paper are further applied to  address the larger theoretical question of whether attrition in AR is induced  by external factors (the dominant language influence in a close language  contact situation) or is motivated internally as a result of language disuse.  It is argued here that while in the area of the lexicon attrition is best  attributed to the dominant language influence, the structural changes in the  grammar of AR support the internal motivation hypothesis as they occur without  any apparent interference from English.<br>

  Jung-Eun  (Janie) Lee&#9474;University  of California,  Santa Barbara</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The  media representation of linguistic varieties is a growing area in  sociolinguistics, but representations of Asian and Asian American speech have  only recently received attention. The present paper adds to this research by  analyzing Hollywood film representations of  Asian languages, drawing on ethnic theory and discourse-analytic methods. I  argue that widespread misrepresentation of Asian languages is closely tied to  what Asian American studies scholars have identified as the problem of  marginalized spectatorship.<br>
          <br>
  The analysis demonstrates three linguistic factors that help constitute  marginalized spectatorship: inaccurate representations of linguistic structure,  which are mainly caused by the common practice of cross-ethnic casting,  inaccurate representations of communicative practices such as the use of names  and address terms, and linguistic and cultural mismatches between the  character&rsquo;s ethnic background and his/her language use.<br>
          The paper demonstrates that despite the recent increase in the number of media  producers and performers of Asian descent, Asian languages are still  inaccurately represented in Hollywood films.<br>

  Sae   Oshima&#9474;University  of Texas at Austin </font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In looking at the service-assessment sequence of haircutting interactions,  this paper examines one of the many complex notions of CA,  preferred/dispreferred turn shapes (Pomerantz 1984), from a multimodal  perspective. Specifically, I explore whether participants simultaneously  produce verbal <em>and</em> embodied actions  for shaping preferred/dispreferred-action turn and what combinations of verbal  and embodied actions are attended to by others as a  &ldquo;display of (dis)satisfaction&rdquo; of a new cut. I argue that a multimodal look at  preferred/dispreferred turn shapes reveals a larger diagram of communicative  resources to display the degree of agreement, satisfaction, and so forth. Such  analysis from this perspective will contribute to a better understanding of  prior CA findings as a whole. In addition to this, it will bring further  explanation to how participants interactionally come to share an agreement  of aesthetic judgment and how a particular product  (e.g. a new haircut) is interactionally achieved, as opposed to solely being  the end result of a professional&rsquo;s trade skills.</font></p>

        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This  paper analyzes narratives of twelve adult American CODAs (hearing &ldquo;children of  deaf adults&rdquo;). The narrators&rsquo; judgments of their own and others&rsquo; family  language practices reveal a recurring theme: communication potentially involves  effort, and failure to put in appropriate effort deserves criticism. The narrators  never state explicitly how they decide when effort is to be expected; however,  an implicit organizing principle is evident: effort is appropriate only to the  degree that it overcomes potential communication barriers. This principle is  shared by all of the interviewees, despite their variation on every demographic  and linguistic measure other than the fact of having deaf parents. In these  narratives, family language choices and the effort they require are judged on  the basis of functionality, with little regard for the language ideologies of  the surrounding Hearing or Deaf communities. The value that these CODAs place  on doing what works&mdash;no more, and no less&mdash;seems to have emerged from their  situation as children of deaf parents, rather than being a learned community  norm.</font></p>

  Robert  Podesva&#9474;Georgetown  University</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Recent  work in variationist sociolinguistics has demonstrated that speakers draw on  the social meaning of variables to construct identities, but few studies have  explicitly identified the ways in which variables are marshaled in negotiating  identity. Based on a detailed study of style shifting among gay professionals,  this paper proposes and illustrates three strategies for negotiating identity  through the use of phonological variables. Speakers can (1) assemble linguistic  features, and their individual social meanings, into a stylistic package; (2)  reconfigure their stylistic packages as they move from one situation to  another, adopting entirely different clusters of variables; and (3) employ  clusters of variables strategically within a situation as the discourse  unfolds, highlighting styles in particular conversational moments. These  strategies provide speakers with considerable room for creativity when managing  their positions in the social world.</font></p>

Schumann (1978) found that societal factors  affect achievement in acquiring a second language.

This study investigates the  relationship between social networks and the acquisition of SLA  accent. Using a cross-sectional design, it explores how network zones relate to  the acquisition of native-like Regional Erzurum Accent (REA) of Turkish by  native Kurds. It addresses the nature and content of Kurds&rsquo; social networks,  their density/multiplexity, and how these networks relate to the acquisition of  REA across different accent levels. Data were collected from 121 middle/high  school students, and included speech samples from a read-aloud accent test, and  three questionnaires. Results show significant variation in participants&rsquo;  accents and reveal that participants with more Turkish-speaking networks  received higher scores on accent. <br>

I put  together a typology, based on shifts in the use of multiple linguistic devices  within a single discourse, to show how lawyers weave together both personal and  authoritative voices to create a persuasive &quot;lawyer persona&quot; that  will hopefully persuade the jurors.</font></p>

  This paper attempts to understand the calibration that individual poets (i.e.,  performers) engage in over time. As such I am concerned with two fundamental  questions concerning poetry (i.e., verbal art). First, what is the role of  multiple genres in the intertextual co-construction of stretches of discourse  that one might term &ldquo;poetry&rdquo;? Second, what is the role of the creative  individual in such demarcated instantiations of a &ldquo;performance&rdquo; over time?  &nbsp;Phrased differently these two questions ask the age old anthropological  query of: What is the relationship between the individual and tradition? I take  as my ethnographic and discursive example, the emergence and calibration of  style by two Navajo poets. </font></p>

Focusing on Chinese American  ethnolinguistic formation in San    Francisco, I suggest that a shift in language from  identity to skill radically complicates the link between language and  ethnicity. In particular, I suggest that the link between ethnicity and what is  understood as &ldquo;heritage language&rdquo; is approaching a point of flexibility, and  that the link between ethnic and linguistic and ethnolinguistic is contingent  and linked closely to imaginations of the political economy. </font></p>
