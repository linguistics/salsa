            Ideologies and Standardization in Quichua-Speaking Ecuador</strong></em></font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
            paper will formally address and elucidate some of the more salient 
            sociolinguistic and ideological aspects of linguistic differentiation 
            in Quichua-speaking Ecuador, with particular emphasis on the ways 
            in which the context of the extant ideologies has influenced the standardization 
            process and the perceptions of Quichua Unificado &#8216;Unified Quichua&#8217;. 
            The semiotic processes of iconization, fractal recursivity, and erasure 
            as proposed by Irvine and Gal (2000), provide a solid basis for this 
            analysis. While these semiotic properties can be observed in essentially 
            all linguistic communities to varying degrees, they shed necessary 
            light on languages such as Quichua, which, although it has a designated 
            and singular minority language status, encompasses a decidedly heterogeneous 
            population of speakers.</font></p>

          <em><strong>Oratorical Footing in a New Medium: Recordings of Presidential 
          Campaign Speeches, 1896-1912</strong></em><br>
          <br>
          When Edison invented the phonograph in 1877, the capacity of the new 
          invention that most impressed him was that it provided the means to 
          overcome the ephemerality of human speech; it made the spoken word durable 
          and available for future reproduction. But what kinds of speech were 
          worthy of being recorded? Understandably, the preservation and dissemination 
          of oratory seemed an appropriate and desirable use for the phonograph. 
          As early as 1896, the new technology of sound recording was employed 
          in political campaigns; by 1908, the new medium had become sufficiently 
          well established to be enlisted in the campaign for the presidency. 
          <br>
          The recorded texts of these campaign speeches and other historical records 
          relating to the use of sound recordings in political campaigns signal 
          the ambiguity of a new medium whose capacities had not yet assumed&#8212;or 
          been disciplined into&#8212;a clear shape; the campaign recordings were 
          unsteadily poised between varying alignments to an audience and other 
          aspects of context. In this paper, we analyze how this work of contextualization 
          was effected, with special attention to how the recorded speeches were 
          aligned to various publics, constituting or reconstituting those publics 
          in the process. </font></p>

          <em><strong>&#8220;The Monkey Said What?&#8221;: Yucatec Mayan Deontic 
          Modality and Metapragmatics</strong></em></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
          this paper I mark the distribution of modal elements in orally performed 
          narratives by Yucatec Maya speakers. In particular, I will look at the 
          distribution of modals and their apparent relationship to discursive, 
          metapragmatic tokens. I argue that the frameworks keyed by discourse-level 
          tokens bind and contextualize social possibilities and necessities through 
          the course of narration.<br>
          In this project I focus on reflexive and pragmatic tokens and their 
          relation to modals. My texts are various transcriptions of historical 
          and mythical stories that have been published by Mayan scholars. Within 
          these narratives, I show a nonrandom distribution of modal elements 
          at the text level, as framed by verbs of saying and other metapragmatic 
          tokens. This distribution suggests that the modal function is subsumed 
          under coherent, culturally specific frameworks, generating themes through 
          manipulation of pragmatic and referential rules in discourse. That is, 
          modals appear when the action and speech of a character are talked about 
          in the course of storytelling. Mapping this distributional pattern shows 
          us the governing principles of truths and obligations (marked by modal 
          tokens) that are coded and reused through the course of many retellings 
          and narrations.</font></p>

            Negotiating Taiwan&#8217;s national identity crisis discourses on 
            political TV call-in shows</em></strong></font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Within 
            Taiwan, two national identity ideologies prevail. One considers Taiwan 
            as a part of &#8220;China&#8221; and its people as being &#8220;Chinese&#8221;, 
            while the other declares Taiwan as a sovereign nation-state with a 
            separate &#8220;Taiwanese&#8221; identity. Thus, discussing the nation&#8217;s 
            or presenting one&#8217;s own national identity is not only sociopolitically 
            controversial in Taiwan, but also proves personally complex for the 
            individual. In my analysis of call-in show discussions, I examine 
            how participants use reported speech, or constructed dialogue, to 
            discuss the issue of national identity. As the literature on reported 
            speech suggests, what is considered to be &#8220;quoted speech&#8221; 
            or &#8220;reported speech&#8221; can be more accurately described 
            as constructing dialogue in an active, creative, and transforming 
            manner (Tannen, 1989). Hypothetical reported speech allows speakers 
            to enact &#8220;thought experiments&#8221; of &#8220;real world&#8221; 
            tensions while reconciling opposing views (Myers, 1999). Drawing from 
            these perspectives, this paper explores how TV call-in show participants 
            strategically use constructed dialogue to animate, negotiate, and 
            perpetuate contesting discourses surrounding Taiwan&#8217;s national 
            identity crisis.</font></p>

            <strong><em>The Meaning of Style</em></strong></font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The field 
            of sociolinguistic variation has not so far developed a coherent theory 
            of the social meaning of variables. This is because it has also not 
            developed a coherent theory of style. The neglect of both is an outgrowth 
            of the roots of the study of variation in the study of dialects and 
            linguistic change. Variables have been selected for study on the basis 
            of their status as being dialect-specific or as reflecting changes 
            in progress and not for their role in the construction of social meaning. 
            And the study of style has been restricted to the interpretation of 
            intra-speaker variation as shifts in formality or alignment with pre-determined 
            social positions. This paper takes off from the fact that our everyday 
            interpretation of the actual use of variability is rich with types 
            and personae&#8212;styles that we might identify as New York Jew or 
            California surfer, but mostly styles that we interpret but have no 
            name for. Our understanding of individual variables is embedded in 
            our interpretation of their role in these styles. I explore a view 
            of variation that begins with the question of style and social meaning, 
            examining variation as stylistic practice. This paper will present 
            speakers&#8217; linguistic performance as a continual construction 
            of a persona (or personae), and variables as resources for this construction. 
            It will explore variables as having indexical potential that is heterogeneous 
            and relatively abstract, and that is vivified&#8212;given greater 
            specificity&#8212;in a given style as it is combined with other variables 
            and embedded in the speaker&#8217;s wider linguistic and non-linguistic 
            practice.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thorough 
              descriptions of some areas of adolescent and adult African American 
              English (AAE) have been presented in the literature over the past 
              40 years; however, the use of AAE by young children has received 
              limited attention. In general, child AAE has been analyzed in the 
              context of communication disorders in efforts to compare normally 
              developing child AAE to impaired uses of the variety. Such studies 
              have been designed to determine the extent to which child AAE speakers 
              use specific isolated features of adolescent and adult AAE that 
              were published in early feature lists characterizing the variety. 
              Research in communication disorders has been targeted toward developing 
              intervention strategies that are useful for treating children with 
              speech and language impairments, so it has not always been concerned 
              with the entire system of AAE that children acquire. In presenting 
              findings from an ongoing study of the use of AAE by 3-, 4- and 5-year 
              olds, I explain the syntactic and semantic patterns that child AAE 
              speakers use and show the ways in which they develop a complete 
              linguistic system, not just a list of features. In addition, I discuss 
              data that provide insight into the way child AAE speakers use remote 
              past BIN to mark the distant past and the way they use preterite 
              had to mark events in narratives. The data description presented 
              here sets the course for research on the early stages of acquisition 
              of AAE.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
              paper investigates the linguistic and interactional processes through 
              which missionary students are socialized into ideologies of language 
              learning and missionary work. Moreover, the paper illustrates how 
              novices adapt those ideologies for their own purposes. I treat language 
              socialization as an interactional process and achievement that involves 
              both novice and expert as agents. Combining ethnography and discourse 
              analysis, I focus on how the interactive nature of storytelling 
              contributes to the socialization of language ideologies in a classroom 
              for future missionaries. In so doing, I aim to illuminate the value

              the process of language socialization; 2) how speakers use written 
              texts in interpreting and assessing stories, thus demonstrating 
              how the socializing influence of written texts can be revealed by 
              talk-in-interaction; 3) how the professor implicitly socializes 
              novices into particular ideologies by assessing, recasting, or building 
              her own second-stories onto the students&#8217; narratives; and 
              4) how novices in the missionary classroom actively employ new ideologies

              in Guadeloupean Voluntary Organizations</strong></em></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A central 
              concern of the literature on Caribbean creoles has been the development 
              of models to explain the distribution of linguistic codes. Most 
              linguists have argued that it is most accurate to describe cases 
              where French-lexified creoles are spoken along with their lexifier 
              as stable diglossic situations, in contrast to those where English-lexified 
              creoles are spoken along with their lexifier, which are described 
              as creole continua marked by decreolization. Still, these categorizations 
              remain a topic of discussion (e.g., Lefebvre, 1974; Meyjes, 1995; 
              Prudent, 1981). In this paper I consider the applicability of the 
              diglossia model (Ferguson, 1959) for describing patterns of language 
              use in Guadeloupe, French West Indies. Guadeloupeans, all French 
              citizens, are generally bilingual in French, the official language, 
              and Kr&eacute;y&ograve;l, a French-lexicon creole. For the present 
              paper, I draw on 100 hours of audio- and videotaped data to explore 
              how people in Guadeloupe use French and Kr&eacute;y&ograve;l in 
              their daily interactions and which model best describes their language 
              use. As a further point, I consider whether or not Guadeloupe&#8217;s 
              linguistic situation is best described as a stable one. In doing 
              so, I will counter the argument of Meyjes (1995) that language shift 
              is occurring in favor of French monolingualism.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I investigate 
              the intersection of language ideology, educational practice, and 
              identity within segments of English lessons in two different public 
              high schools in Tokyo, Japan, one a technical high school, the other 
              a liberal arts high school. This study explores the complexity of 
              values concerning English language constructed during lessons. In 
              lessons in both schools, a piece of text, the design of an activity, 
              or a teacher&#8217;s elaboration will thematize explicitly a distance 
              between English language and Japanese national subjectivity. However, 
              at a different level of explicitness, utterances and words often 
              display moments of simultaneity (Woolard, 1999), where words come 
              to inhabit a kind of translinguistic space somewhere between English 
              and Japanese. Differences in practices between the two schools construct 
              different educational class identities. </font></p>

              Chants</strong></em></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
              structure of verbal art and the grammar of everyday speech have 
              been argued to be intimately related by scholars from a variety 
              of theoretical backgrounds. A major theme in this line of research 
              is that poetic forms are generated by the artistic redeployment 
              of linguistic resources already present in the grammar of a language 
              (Jakobson, 1968; Sherzer, 1990; Tannen 1989). This paper evaluates 
              and explores this claim by examining the poetic structure of a particular 
              verbal art form in relation to the grammar of the language spoken 
              by its performers. The verbal art form I examine is karintaa, an 
              extemporaneously composed poetic form performed by the Nantis of 
              the Peruvian Amazon. Focusing on the phenomenon of vowel lengthening 
              in these chants, I compare this prosodic phenomenon with the grammaticalized 
              prosodic structure of everyday Nanti speech. To make my comparison 
              maximally explicit, I adopt an optimality theoretic framework in 
              which I take extemporaneous karintaa to be outputs of a canonical 
              optimality-theoretic constraint system that serves to force inputs 
              (which are everyday utterances) to more closely match the prosodic 
              structure of the refrain.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">University 
              commencement rituals inhabit Padua&#8217;s urban landscape, centering 
              on the graduate&#8217;s reading from the papiro, or scroll, in front 
              of friends and family. Scrolls include hypersexualized images of 
              graduates and rhymed poems that recount their lives, particularly 
              sexually explicit moments. I analyze graduation scrolls in both 
              as a ritual and literacy shaping and shaped by gender and classed 
              identities and understandings. How does this reading evoke various 
              linguistic ideologies as scrolls are written in standard Italian, 
              the regional Veneto dialect and English? I interrogate how this 
              linguistic practice both challenges and reinforces existing understandings 
              of gender, sex and class. I also focus on how the actions of graduates 
              during the ritual, and the visual images on scrolls, confirm, and 
              sometimes contradict, the written narrative. After an introduction 
              to the history of scrolls in Padua, I analyze one man&#8217;s scroll 
              with specific attention to embedded voices and code-switching between 
              Veneto dialect and standardized Italian. Together with ethnographic 
              details, close linguistic analysis, and a variety of theoretical 
              insights, I undertake an analysis of this unique graduation ritual, 
              carefully examining debasement, parody, and the reconstitution of

            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Obituaries 
              are perhaps the most frequently read section of the daily newspaper. 
              They note the passing of friends and acquaintances, the famous and 
              the infamous. They recount the life stories of ordinary people and 
              people of power. These short essays also give us a glimpse into 
              the shape and cultural interpretation of life and death. In this 
              paper we examine a sample of obituaries drawn from The New York 
              Times 1983-2002. The sample includes both those articles written 
              by Times writers and the paid notices authored by family and friends. 
              A text grammar is proposed based on Brown and Yule's (1983) discourse 
              topic framework. The four parts of the text grammar are analyzed. 
              We argue that the language of obituaries reveals important understandings 
              of the beliefs our society holds about our lives and our deaths, 
              especially with respect to the causes of death, life expectancy, 
              and gender differences in our life stories. The textual analysis 
              of obituaries offers an intriguing view of how we understand living 
              and dying in our society today.</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
              paper addresses a current debate over the universality of ideophones, 
              a class of expressions that are used to simulate, through performative 
              foregrounding, the salient processes and perceptions of everyday 
              life experience. Using data from Quechua-speaking Runa in Amazonian 
              Ecuador, I argue for a view of ideophones as a type of cultural 
              discourse through which speakers align themselves with nonhuman 
              life forms and forces of nature. This alignment is suggested by 
              the special performative properties of ideophones, which collapse 
              the distinction between a speech event and a narrated event, thus 
              compelling a speaker to become an action, event, or process, in 
              order to communicate about it. My argument finds support in Quechua 
              data from a variety of discourse genres, including life history 
              narratives, myths, and casual conversations. While there may be 
              a universal tendency for all languages to develop ideophones, there 
              are extralinguistic factors that can constrain or inhibit their 
              emergence as a fully blown class of expressions with unique formal 
              properties. Evidence for the importance of extralinguistic factors 
              to ideophonic development or decay comes from comparative data on 
              Zulu and Japanese ideophone usage, as well as the functionally restricted 
              use of ideophones by speakers of English.</font></p>

              by the use of stereotypical American English phrases and expressions 
              that are clearly elementary, as well as hyper-Koreanized pronunciation 
              of words. Together with the use of subtitling that does not presume 
              a complex understanding of English, these practices contribute to 
              a construction of a negative English competence for Koreans. This 
              negative competence can be analyzed as an ideological construct, 
              as it is treated as something that is shared among all Koreans.<br>
              I argue that this ideology of &quot;Koreans as bad speakers of English&quot; 
              may lead Koreans to perceive their community as being subordinate 
              to that of native English speakers, thus reproducing the cultural 
              hegemony of English in the globalizing world (Pennycook, 1994, 1998). 
              This suggests that, in contrast to Mock Spanish (Hill, 1993, 2001), 
              construction of competence may also be used in a self-deprecative 
              manner, causing a community of speakers to put themselves in a subordinate 
              position in relation to other dominant communities.</font></p>

              Identity and the Ex-Gay Narrative</strong></em></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
              this paper, I analyze the personal narratives of &#8220;ex-gay&#8221; 
              individuals who are attempting to transform their sexual identity 
              in order to bring this identity in line with their understanding 
              of evangelical Christian theology. Liang (1997) footnotes a distinction 
              between &#8220;coming out stories,&#8221; i.e. narratives of realizing 
              and accepting homosexual identity, and accounts of homosexuality 
              given in ex-gay ministries; however, no sociolinguistic investigation 
              of ex-gay narratives and their distinct differences has been published. 
              Here I examine ex-gay narratives and compare the language and identity 
              issues they present with research on coming-out stories.<br>
              Based on the analysis of 20 hours of data from ten ethnographic 
              &#8220;life history&#8221; interviews (5 males and 5 females), I 
              found that ex-gay narratives reveal a plot-initial tension similar 
              to coming-out stories in the recognition and self-naming of homosexual 
              identity. However, within ex-gay narratives, religious discourse 
              about homosexuality creates an inter-textual identity conflict and 
              leads them to begin a complex process of re-naming and acquiring 
              new discourse. Ex-gay narratives provide a significant opportunity 
              to observe individuals using language as the primary tool to not 
              only express identity but also create and transform it. My analysis 
              of these narratives also reveals how individuals&#8217; identities 
              and discourse replicate and are constrained by religious Discourse.</font></p>

                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Across 
                  America, hearing parents are encouraging their hearing 1-year-olds 
                  to use visual-gestural signs, either ASL signs or invented symbolic 
                  gestures, hoping to promote earlier and clearer parent-child 
                  communication. Most baby-signing families have no exposure to 
                  a natural sign language or to the Deaf community. Spoken English 
                  remains the families&#8217; main communication mode, with parents 
                  signing occasionally as they speak and children producing single 
                  signs, words, or sign-word pairs. Once the children become proficient 
                  in speech, most families stop signing. This paper investigates 
                  the role of baby signing in hearing children&#8217;s language 
                  socialization, with attention to the language ideologies that 
                  underlie the practice. Data were collected from three sources: 
                  1) videotapes of three babysigning 1-year-olds interacting with 
                  other family members at home, 2) interviews with the children&#8217;s 
                  parents, and 3) writings on baby signing in the mass media and 
                  online. Both the existence of baby signing and the ways that 
                  it is used are consistent with the portrait of middle class 
                  American language socialization given in Ochs and Schieffelin 
                  (1984), but individual families vary in their uses of signs 
                  depending on their children&#8217;s development and on their 
                  families&#8217; interactional styles.</font></p>

                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                  emergence of a new sign language in Nicaragua over the past 
                  25 years highlights selection and information as key components 
                  in language change. Theoretical perspectives informed by cybernetic 
                  systems theories, such as those put forth by anthropologist 
                  Gregory Bateson and developmental psychologist Jean Piaget identify 
                  principles common to both evolutionary and ontogenetic processes, 
                  though the expression of these principles differ in these analytically 
                  distinct processes. Unlike other approaches, cybernetic theories 
                  account for the range of interacting phenomena in several domains; 
                  environmental, biological, social and cultural (including linguistic). 
                  The history of this new sign language, including specific grammatical 
                  changes, and ethnographic observations show that cybernetic 
                  perspectives clarify factors involved. For example, borrowed 
                  linguistic forms, emerging grammatical constraints and even 
                  referential confusion during discourse are all more understandable 
                  in light of systems-level perspectives.<br>
                  Dan Slobin argues that older individuals have introduced the 
                  new elements in this emerging language, not children. Ann Senghas 
                  and her colleagues have argued that deaf Nicaraguan children 
                  have introduced grammar to Nicaraguan Sign Language. These seemingly 
                  opposing views can be resolved with cybernetic perspectives 
                  that account for both universal evolutionary principles and 
                  historical particularism, thereby unifying approaches to historical 
                  change and ontogenetic development&#8212;without conflating 
                  the two.</font></p>

                  paper explores the motivations behind the survival of Tulu, 
                  a minority language in South India, despite sociopolitical reasons 
                  for its speakers to shift to Kannada, a larger and more economically 
                  viable language. I argue that the lack of codeswitching between 
                  Tulu and Kannada has facilitated the maintenance of Tulu in 
                  the South Kannara district of South India where Tulu is largely 
                  spoken. Individual interviews were conducted with 15 informants 
                  in South Kannara and in Bombay to elicit information about language 
                  attitudes and language identity. Based on these interviews, 
                  I examine the various motivations&#8212;linguistic, social, 
                  and political&#8212;as to why speakers do not codeswitch between 
                  Tulu and Kannada in South Kannara. I then compare the linguistic 
                  situation in South Kannara to the situation in the city of Bombay 
                  (which has the largest number of Tulu speakers outside South 
                  Kannara) where there is codeswitching, and language shift from 
                  Tulu to other languages is taking place. The findings of this 
                  study illustrate the complexity of language contact situations 
                  and the role of codeswitching, language identity, and language

                  Discourse Analysts investigate how ideology and power are instantiated 
                  in language. Rhetoricians of science investigate the role of 
                  persuasion in the construction of scientific knowledge. I show 
                  how these approaches can be integrated. As a case study, I use 
                  media representations of a study presented to the American Psychiatric 
                  Association that concluded that &#8220;highly motivated&#8221; 
                  gay men and lesbians can &#8220;achieve good heterosexual functioning.&#8221; 
                  I trace how the original presentation of the study is recontextualized 
                  in an Associated Press (AP) article on the study, press releases 
                  from &#8220;ex-gay&#8221; organizations and gay/lesbian/bisexual/transgender 
                  (GLBT) rights organizations responding to the study, and articles 
                  written for conservative and GLBT audiences about the study. 
                  I first examine how these stories were framed in the headlines 
                  and lead paragraphs. In general, the story was framed as controversy 
                  in the AP and GLBT articles, and as groundbreaking, newsworthy 
                  research or flawed, politically motivated research in the &#8220;ex-gay&#8221; 
                  and GLBT press releases respectively. Second, I examine how 
                  scientific topoi are deployed and evaluated in defining this 
                  study as good or bad science. This analysis suggests that both 
                  &#8220;sides&#8221; define what science is in essentially the 
                  same way, but differ in how they evaluate this study with respect

                  paper investigates the use of humor between Japanese and American 
                  workers on a southern US factory floor, a highly task-oriented 
                  setting. While working as a liaison officer, I gathered ethnographic 
                  and discourse data through observation, interviews, and video-taping 
                  of interactions. Most previous &#8220;intercultural&#8221; studies 
                  observe non-native speakers who occupy inferior positions in 
                  a given context. However, in the present setting, the Japanese 
                  workers are superior to the local American workers with respect 
                  to their experience and hierarchy. Thus, interactions between 
                  the two groups took place in the context of more balanced power 
                  relations. The purpose of this study is to examine how, despite 
                  their serious linguistic limitations, workers in the two groups 
                  managed to utilize humor while working together. Firstly, humor 
                  strengthened the bonds among them. In using humor, the workers 
                  of the two groups made the most of what they had in common. 
                  Secondly, humor functioned to release tension in stressful situations. 
                  Finally, it was used for a contestive purpose from the American, 
                  or the subordinate, side. The findings of this study present 
                  not only the multifunctional nature of humor, but also the fact 
                  that &#8220;national characteristics&#8221; are not necessarily

                  I analyze adolescent uses of parental insults to collaboratively 
                  establish and subvert &#8216;respectful&#8217; behavior in an 
                  Algerian immigrant community outside Paris. In performances 
                  of parental name-calling that negotiate the boundaries between 
                  play and insult, adolescents both structure and symbolize social 
                  relationships with their peers and their parents. In addition 
                  to expressing shifting affiliations with peers and kin, these 
                  performances represent both cultural change and continuity in 
                  a diasporic context. Through them, adolescents articulate conflicting 
                  beliefs about public space, gender, and generation. With respect 
                  to adolescent social networks and group identity, these verbal 
                  performances are central in three ways. First, they are often 
                  embedded in interaction and so are difficult for adults or outsiders 
                  to understand. Second, they symbolically pose parents and adolescents 
                  in oppositional and yet dependent terms. Third, parental name-calling 
                  functions as a personalized form of deixis to &#8216;point&#8217; 
                  toward a specific peer, thereby creating a social context for

                  analysis, interactional sociolinguistics, and critical discourse 
                  approaches; at the same time, it is quite distinct. In this 
                  paper I describe how AIDA is similar to and different from these 
                  approaches. In addition, drawing on studies of several communicative 
                  practices (e.g., school board meetings, citizen-911 telephone 
                  exchanges, and academic colloquia), I make visible the kinds 
                  of questions AIDA is particularly well suited to address.</font></p>

                  <em><strong>Complaint Sequences Reconsidered: A Consideration

                <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
                  study examines and compares interview data by Japanese language 
                  learners in a U.S. institutional setting. Specifically, I reconsider 
                  &#8220;complaint sequences&#8221; (Roulston, 2000) in research 
                  interview settings from a conversation analytic perspective. 
                  Past studies indicate that complaining is a &#8220;category-generated&#8221; 
                  activity in which an informant and a researcher share a co-membership 
                  category and the researcher tends to become a recipient of complaints 
                  if s/he shares co-categorial incumbency. However, as a researcher, 
                  I found that I became a recipient of complaints even though 
                  the informants and I seemingly differ in terms of gender, &#8220;race&#8221; 
                  or ethnicity, and/or nationality. I argue that rather than assuming 
                  these larger &#8220;categories,&#8221; informants treat the 
                  researcher as a person (presumably) having extensive knowledge 
                  about the topics they are complaining about. Methodologically, 
                  follow-up interviews are found to be effective to reveal the 
                  ideologies of informants more clearly by prompting reformulations 
                  of &#8220;unsafe&#8221; complaints (Sacks, 1992).</font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
