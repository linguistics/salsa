            <b>On the Evaluation of Reported Speech by French Adolescents: Ouais
            as Discourse Marker</b></i><br>
            <br>
            Reported speech often serves as an important context for evaluations
            and assessments of others. In an analysis of naturally occurring speech
            among students in a suburban Paris secondary school, I consider the
            ways in which French adolescents (ages 16-19) employ the nonstandard
            affirmative "ouais" as a prefatory discourse marker in direct reported
            speech. I argue that the use of this marker serves to signal the banal
            or predictable nature of the recycled speech that it introduces. As
            such, "ouais" is frequently found in animations of others who are 
            perceived as representative of negatively evaluated identities and/or 
            ideologies.</font></p>

          <b>Invoking the Ancestors: Sapir, Bugs Bunny, and the Popol Vuh</b></i><br>
          <br>
          By focusing on Bugs Bunny and selected Looney Tunes, I support the hypothesis 
          that in the current broader culture of the United States, many toons 
          serve the functions of ancestors. Sapir (1915[1991]), describing Nootka 
          and several other cultures, detailed sound changes that occur in specific 
          social contexts, including ritual storytelling; I show how speech features 
          of specific toons follow the same and similar patterns. Secondly, by 
          presenting some salient parallels between the Popol Vuh and Space Jam, 
          a 1996 film starring Bugs Bunny and Michael Jordan, I discuss characteristics 
          that Looney Tunes share with ancestors of the Quiche Maya.</font></p>

          <b>Play, Identity, and Linguistic Representation in the Performance 
          of Accent</b></i></font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Scholarship 
          on verbal play and performance has demonstrated the importance of the 
          aesthetic realm for the linguistic study of cultural production and 
          social practice. Such research opens up new avenues for the sociolinguistic 
          inquiry into identity. This paper considers one such site of identity 
          making in performance among science fiction and fantasy fans in Texas. 
          A powerful popular ideology holds that fans lack the basic communicative 
          competence necessary to function socially. Fans are often stigmatized 
          as "nerds" who seek out the alternative realities of speculative fiction 
          to escape social isolation and inadequacy. I focus on a complex verbal 
          performance, a live-action role-playing game, to demonstrate the sociolinguistic 
          competence of fans and to offer anaccount of how identity is linguistically 
          produced on multiple levels.</font></p>
        <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
          focus of the analysis is the performance of a range of accents by players 
          and non-player characters. Accent performance serves several purposes 
          within the game, including bounding the game world, creating characterizations, 
          and displaying interactional stances. In addition, the selection and 
          performance of particular accents ties the game both intertextually 
          to previous enactments of the fantastic and ideologically to specific 
          racial and ethnic categories. Through these multilayered functions, 
          language effects identity at several levels. The performance of accent 
          is therefore part of the broader phenomenon of linguistic representation, 
          a set of processes whereby linguistic forms are assigned social meanings.</font></p>

            <b>Unraveling the Confederate Flag: Discourse Frameworks as Ideological 
            Constraints</b></i><br>
            <br>
            In this paper I present evidence that Confederate flag discourse is 
            characterized by a framework of assumptions that marginalizes African-American 
            experience and takes as given "white Southern" claims on identity. 
            Lexical items such as "Confederate" and "history" co-occur far more 
            frequntly than parallel associations representing African-American 
            experience. Drawing on Bourdieu, I claim these patterns constitute 
            a framework of norms that shapes and is shaped by participants' linguistic
            choices. The language of the debate not only reflects how people view 
            their social organization but also reaffirms the social world in place, 
            constraining people from readily thinking of it in other terms.</font></p>

            <b>Performance and Encoding of Agency in Historical-Natural Languages 
            </b></i><br>
            <br>
            After providing a working definition of agency, I will suggest that 
            there are two mutually constitutive and yet analytically distinct 
            dimensions of agency that are enacted in and through language: performance 
            and representation. In the performance dimension, I distinguish between 
            "ego-affirming" and "context-constituting" agency. In the representation 
            dimension, I concentrate on grammatical framing and discuss two related 
            principles and their implications: (i) all natural languages allow 
            for the representation of agency; (ii) all natural languages allow 
            for the mitigation of agency.</font></p>

              <b>Taakin Braad and Talking Broad: Changing Indexicality of Phonetic 
              Variants in Two Contact Situations</b></i><br>
              <br>
              In this paper we consider the changing indexicality of phonological 
              variants in two different contact situations-Corby, England, and
              Kingston, Jamaica. We suggest that similar sociolinguistic phenomena
              may be observed in both places. Using a language ideology framework,
              acoustic and auditory phonetic data are interpreted through respondents' 
              own metalinguistic comments about their dialect. This socially embedded 
              interpretation of the data reveals that in both Corby and Kingston 
              one phonological variant may in fact index distinct and different 
              identities for speakers in the respective communities, thereby questioning 
              the discreteness of "independent" variables, such as place or social 
              class in sociolinguistic studies.</font></p>

              in Indonesia</b></i><br>
              <br>
              This paper analyzes a performance of the Belian, a shamanic healing 
              ritual practiced by the Petalangan people in Indonesia to discuss 
              the tensions between situatedness (contingency) and transcendence 
              (analogy) of ritual speech. I analyze the usage of address and referential 
              terms and personal pronouns, by which a shaman mediates the present 
              context and the supernatural world during the performance. My concerns 
              focus on the interrelations between indexicality and iconicity of 
              the Belian performance and the importance of the Petalangan concept 
              of the 'relational' self, which mediates 'contextualization' and
              'entextualization' processes of the ritual.</font></p>

              "gossiping" within focus group interactions among adolescent males 
              (ages 14-15). In line with recent linguistic anthropological work, 
              I argue that the meanings of different linguistic strategies are 
              not only relative to the specific interactions, but are also quite 
              precarious as indexes of varying levels of solidarity among the 
              adolescent males. Using Positioning Analysis, I demonstrate how 
              subject positions are made available and linguistically indexed. 
              The resulting argument stands as relatively novel, sociolinguistic 
              contribution in ongoing explorations of how micro-discursive positions 
              constitute gendered identities.</font></p>

              <b>Mix-Im-Up Speech and Emergent Mixed Languages in Indigenous Australia 
              </b></i><br>
              <br>
              The numbers of speakers of Australian Indigenous languages are plunging, 
              but some languages are changing radically. Two such languages are 
              examined here: Tiwi and Gurindji. Tiwi in its traditional form is 
              highly headmarking and polysynthetic. Modern Tiwi has retained some 
              of the old verb morphology but adopted English nominal grammar. 
              Traditional Gurindji is a language of dependentmarking type. Young 
              people have adopted verbal grammar from the local English-based 
              creole, but retained Gurindji case-marking on nominals, the obverse 
              of the situation with Tiwi. The origins of this new mixed language 
              can be traced to the code-switching speech of the previous generation.</font></p>

              <b>Secrecy Versus Education: Cultural Maintenance and the Dilemma 
              of Educating Non-Indians about the Pueblos</b></i><br>
              <br>
              The purpose of this paper is to examine how cultures, specifically 
              the Pueblo Indian cultures, can be maintained in the presence of 
              outside cultural influence. In the last 400 years, Pueblo culture 
              has been dramatically changed by the influx of first Hispanic and 
              later Anglo cultural influences. Analysis of current programs to 
              maintain culture reveal a foundation of building cultural identity 
              as well as language skills and conformity to group cohesion principles. 
              Non-Pueblo individuals were found to have a limited role in cultural 
              preservation, however the education of non-Pueblo people has the 
              potential to be both a constructive and destructive force.</font></p>

              </i>This paper describes and analyzes the use of reported speech 
              by speakers of Nanti, an Arawakan language of southeastern Peru. 
              It seeks to understand the importance of reported speech in the 
              Nanti communicative repertoire, and its relationship to broader 
              communicative, ideational, and political patterns. Based on ethnographic 
              data, I argue that Nanti speech reporting practices realize a linguistic/ideational 
              complex that links communicative practice to conceptualizations 
              of experience, knowledge, and the relationship between experience 
              and knowledge. On the basis of comparative analyses with other societies, 
              I also advance hypotheses about the cross-cultural properties of 
              reported speech as a social practice.</font></p>

              <i><b>Poetic Structures of an Ethnographic Narrative</b></i><br>
              <br>
              This presentation analyzes narrative sections of healthrelated interview 
              transcripts. My purpose here is to highlight the poetic structures 
              they substantiate: this includes blocking text into verses, stanzas, 
              and refrains, and using thematic parallelism. Although a familiar 
              literary resource, poetics has only recently been applied to casual 
              discourse. The present analysis will document the occurrence of 
              poetic styles in impromptu interview speech and hypothesize the 
              social functions of such styles: significantly, that these poetic 
              structures are textual markers which have a social function much 
              like other stylized verbal forms.</font></p>

              <br>
              This ethnography explores how members of a rap 'crew' of inner-city 
              teenagers use language to construct their various ethnic and local 
              identities and their common identities as hip-hoppers and males. 
              Crew members combine openminded discourses on ethnicity, national 
              origin, and neighborhood as potential sources of pride but not exclusiveness 
              with unapologetically sexist views. I argue that rather than analyzing 
              these discourses as contradictory, they are better understood as 
              outgrowths of a single coherent meritocratic and individualistic 
              worldview. As such, these teens use traditional American capitalist 
              discourses to respond to the dominant discourses of dehumanization 
              they face as minority youth.</font></p>

              </i>"Language death" rules out possible continued uses as a heritage 
              language. Language efforts typical of Native American languages 
              (preservation/revival efforts, curriculum, technology use) are hampered 
              not only by English use, but also by no desire for English-like 
              functions in the traditional variety (because of emotional and religious 
              factors). In the 1960s, Monegasque (traditional in Monaco) was in 
              a similar situation; it went through a period of "preservation" 
              to become a heritage language used in important, vital public contexts. 
              The Monegasque model is an alternative to the Hawaiian model of 
              total revival as an educational medium.</font></p>

              Many of the limitations minorities face arguably involve differing 
              ideologies about how and where certain language forms can be used 
              and what their use indexes. This paper looks at the language ideologies 
              that manifest in an adult education program aimed at training African 
              Americans for jobs in the hospitality industry and how these ideologies 
              relate to the students' employment opportunities in customer service 
              positions. By looking closely at how and what ideologies are explicitly 
              and implicitly expressed, the local (re)production of certain sociocultural 
              attitudes and their effect on the employment opportunities of the 
              speakers may be better understood and addressed.</font></font></p>
