                in Support of Bidialectalism among Speakers of Pennsylvania Dutchified 
                English / South Central Pennsylvania Regional Standard English 
                </b></i><br>
                <br>
                While the issue of whether any speaker can be a genuine bidialectal 
                remains controversial, it is nonetheless true that speakers exist 
                who maintain two "ways of speaking" that correspond to dialects 
                to which they are exposed. One argument against the bidialectal 
                status of such speakers is skepticism that their "ways of speaking" 
                are distinct enough from each other to be classified as separate 
                dialects. This does not seem to be the case, however, for a set 
                of speakers in south central Pennsylvania whose two "ways of speaking" 
                correspond to Pennsylvania Dutchified English (PDE) and to a regional 
                standard of English, both dialects these speakers have been in 
                contact with since childhood. This paper presents evidence for 
                the use of low-level, complex rules which guide the separation 
                between the "PDE mode" and "standard English mode" of these potential 
                bidialectals and argues, on that basis, that these speakers do 
                indeed exhibit native mastery of two dialects and thus fulfill 
                the distinctiveness criterion for bidialectalism.</font></p>

              <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
                work examines language ideologies with respect to language shift, 
                standardization and ethnolinguistic identity within the Quichua-speaking 
                community of Salasaca, Ecuador. Language ideologies frequently 
                being a reflection of the inherent social structure in a speech 
                community (Silverstein 1979), this research investigates the role 
                that ideology plays in speakers' ethnolinguistic identities, and 
                how it can affect the process and progress of language standardization, 
                revitalization and shift. In addition to the analysis of interviews, 
                metalinguistic and other natural language discourse, the primary 
                locus of data for this research is the locally-established and 
                community-run radio station in Salasaca, Radio Haelli. This analysis 
                explicates the ways in which Salasaca Quichua speakers both maintain 
                and mediate their own ethnolinguistic identities, while simultaneously 
                endorsing a nationally-standardized Quichua language movement, 
                through both radio and interpersonal discourse.</font></p>

                <i><b>Recontextualizing the Bible in Small Group Discourse </b></i><br>
                <br>
                This paper contributes to research on recontextualizing discourse, 
                particularly in religious language. I observe this phenomenon 
                in group Bible study, a key discourse site for US Protestants. 
                I argue that recontextualizations of the Bible in group discourse 
                provide a meta-commentary for interpreting scripture. Differences 
                in recontextualization are traced to differing assumptions about 
                the Bible, and thus distinct interpretive ideologies for Biblical 
                exegesis. This is demonstrated in two men's Bible studies, one 
                United Methodist and one Missouri Synod Lutheran. In the former, 
                recontextualizations embed interpretations that display an eagerness 
                for connecting the Bible to contemporary issues; even if that 
                relevance means straying from the original textual meaning. In 
                the Lutheran case, recontextualizations attempt to preserve the 
                text's literary and historical context. These differing intertextualities 
                also help create distinct interactive frames. In the former, multiple 
                interpretations are allowed to co-exist. In the latter, the group 
                is constantly constructing a hermeneutic method.</font></p>

                Different Space- and Time-Saving Strategies in English and German

                <br>
                According to media and industry reports, the popularity of SMS 
                (short text messaging on cellular phones) has been experiencing 
                enormous growth since texting was launched commercially in 1995 
                and will most likely increase even further in the years to come, 
                particularly in the US. Nevertheless, the linguistic properties 
                of text messaging have hitherto only received comparatively little 
                attention. So far, most studies have analyzed SMS with respect 
                to one language only and many scholars have made generalizations 
                about the properties of so-called "texting language" or "Textspeak" 
                that do not hold true when being applied to other languages. The 
                length of text messages is limited to 160 characters. This paper 
                analyzes the different means employed to shorten text messages 
                and argues that the space- and time- saving strategies used in 
                English and German differ structurally and by frequency. The paper 
                thus addresses a desideratum in computer-mediated communication 
                (CMC) research and sets the scene for future studies concerning

                paper explores language ideologies in the context of Tanzanian 
                beauty pageants through analysis of the speech of contestants. 
                In Tanzania, where Swahili serves as a lingua franca, but where 
                over 120 ethnic languages are spoken and English is embraced as 
                an elite world language, beauty pageants offer a site where ideologies 
                about language emerge. In these events, contestants' language 
                use is a focus of explicit attention and critique, as well as 
                more implicit judgment. Findings highlight the fact that, through 
                various semiotic processes, local ethnic languages are virtually 
                invisible in these public contexts and that, despite discourses 
                to the contrary, contestants' use of English rather than Swahili 
                seriously increases their chances for victory. Conclusions articulate 
                the real-life consequences of linguistic ideologies, showing that 
                they play an important role in processes of language shift, as 
                well as in the success of would-be beauty queens. </font></p>

                <br>
                edu In this paper I analyze communication in jazz music rehearsals, 
                focusing specifically on talk about improvisation and interplay. 
                Jazz is a musical art form that places a high value on improvisational 
                creativity. Popular wisdom suggests that creativity cannot be 
                taught, that you either 'have it' or you don't, so when jazz is 
                placed in the classroom, there is a unique opportunity to learn 
                something about the possibility of teaching students how to be 
                creative. My participant-observation of jazz rehearsals and analysis 
                video-recorded rehearsals reveals that instructors display a noticeable 
                preference for avoiding discussion of the specifics of collaborative 
                improvisation. Still, I argue, key information is subtly communicated 
                through the pragmatics of instructors' utterances. I document 
                a disjuncture between the pragmatics and metapragmatics of communication 
                in jazz rehearsals, and explain how this tension allows instructors 
                to communicate some of the prerequisites of jazz performance while 
                still providing students with opportunities for creative musical 
                interplay. </font></p>

                <i><b>From Bite to Nip: The Dialogic Construction of Teases </b></i><br>
                <br>
                This paper discusses the dialogic nature of teases. A tease is 
                on the surface a criticism, or derogatory comment, that is understood 
                to be playful in context. The dataset for this study is based 
                on a video recording of four young men playing poker and the constant 
                teasing that ensues. The study confirms a point noted in earlier 
                research (Drew, 1987; Tholander & Aronsson, 2002, for example) 
                that the nature of a potential tease is in part determined by 
                the way it is received. After discussing the various types of 
                responses to teases, several examples will be analyzed with a 
                particular focus on how the teases are used in masculine discourse 
                to serve group alignment, initiation, and identity goals. One 
                conclusion made is that the young men being analyzed seem to enjoy 
                and find useful in their larger communicative goals the inherent 
                ambiguity in teases; they often give teases with minimal contextualization 
                cues that normally would signal their intention as playful. </font></p>

                members have served as interpreters for their parents in institutional 
                contexts since they migrated as children over fifty years ago. 
                They extend this practice to the family context, brokering between 
                first- and third-generation family members in two ways. Solicited 
                interpreting occurs when speakers verbally request clarification 
                or when second-generation members perceive conversational sequence 
                problems. Unsolicited interpreting is neither requested nor sequentially 
                triggered. Second-generation members report acting to bridge linguistic 
                and cultural gaps between their Italian-dominant immigrant parents 
                and their English-dominant Canadian/US-born children. Interpreting 
                in multi-generational conversations is one way through which this 
                bridging role is (re)constructed. In the language shift process, 
                the middle generation serves as a cultural and linguistic broker 
                within the family just as they do between family and outsiders.</font></p>

                The predominance of the periphrastic future in Latin American 
                Spanish has been extensively studied, due to the fact that the 
                extension of its use is in the process of replacing the morphological 
                future. It has been found that at present MF frequently is used 
                as a modal marker to express doubt instead of marking future and 
                PF is assigned to futurity. In this project we combine the variationist 
                perspective with a functional analysis to investigate if the same 
                extension of PF found in other varieties is occurring in New Mexican 
                Spanish. New Mexican Spanish allows us to discover the effects 
                of language contact in the extension of PF. </font></p>

                <br>
                This paper examines the role of sexuality in the use of Hindi 
                and English in northern India, focusing on an NGO in New Delhi 
                that has as its mandate the distribution of HIV/AIDS education 
                and sexual information to the public. In particular, I discuss 
                the ways in which women associated with sexual alterity, specifically 
                those who identify as either "boys" (an eroticized transgender 
                identity) or "lesbians" (an identity more closely allied with 
                same-sex desire as articulated in Europe and the United States), 
                engage with global and national discourses that legitimate English 
                as the language of modernity and Hindi as the language of tradition. 
                Because Hindu nationalism has become increasingly associated with 
                the Hindi language, employees within this NGO tend to view Hindi 
                as an oppressive medium for the expression of both sexual practice 
                and sexual identity, rejecting traditionalist assumptions regarding 
                the position of Hindi in the contemporary nation-state. Middle 
                class women who participate in NGO activities, aspiring to a class 
                symbolic that opposes the perceived conservative understanding 
                of sexuality voiced in traditional India, socialize newcomers 
                away from their transsexual imaginings in part by offering them 
                English as a new medium for talking about sex. The paper thus 
                highlights the ways in which progressive NGO discourses of sexual 
                identity, here carried through globalized forms of English, produce 
                differential effects on distinct class-based sexualities. </font></p>

                Much of the large literature on parallelism and "ritual speech"

                structure of the genres or on the striking semantic imagery involved. 
                I will return to a topic I first approached ethnographically in 
                a paper at a conference in Austin about 20 years ago--Zinacantec 
                diphrasism and "ritual speech" in "non-ritual" contexts--to consider 
                instead the interactive effects of Tzotzil parallel genres in 
                two more or less extemporized contexts: wedding exhortations where 
                new couples are verbally enveloped in a marital creed by elders, 
                and extemporized semi-drunken harangues that echo and parody such 
                exhortations in other circumstances. The theme is the indexical 
                interplay between genre, participant, and activity, where linguistic 
                form mediates distinct but simultaneous layers of action and social 
                structure. </font></p>

                <b><i>Linguistic Perspectives on Persistent Conversation: Towards 
                a Morphology of Instant Messaging </i></b><br>
                <br>
                Casual spoken conversation tends to be highly variable, exhibiting 
                limited structure at the global, schematic level. Text-based Instant 
                Messaging (IM) exchanges resemble prototypical casual conversation: 
                they are synchronous, dyadic, and frequently engaged in for phatic 
                purposes. However, in contrast to spoken conversations, IM conversations 
                leave a persistent trace, which allows them to be tracked and 
                reviewed. This talk adapts principles of conversation analysis 
                and exchange structure analysis to Instant Messaging. Specifically, 
                it addresses the question: Do IM conversations have predictable 
                schematic structure? <br>
                <br>
                The data are a corpus of 200 IM conversations produced by undergraduate 
                students at Indiana University. A visualization tool, VisualDTA 
                (Kurtz & Herring 2004), is used to display the results of the 
                analysis. In this talk, I focus on identifying abstract units 
                of conversation that emerge using VisualDTA: meaningful chunks 
                of structure, such as 'greeting sequence', 'topic drift', and 
                'digression', that combine to form longer conversations. These 
                findings expand and support the observation of Ford (2003) that 
                synchronous computer-mediated chat is more routinized than comparable 
                face-to-face interaction. <br>
                <br>
                I conclude by proposing explanations for why Instant Messaging 
                should be predictably structured, including the leanness of the 
                text-only medium, which filters out potentially distracting social 
                cues; its written, persistent nature; and the fact that young 
                people typically engage in IM exchanges simultaneous with other 
                activities, reducing the attentional resources available for producing 
                and processing IM messages. <br>

                <br>
                - weakening of the voiced pharyngeal fricative <br>
                - weakening of secondary pharyngealization of "emphatic" coronals 
                <br>
                <br>
                A corpus of urban Palestinian Arabic is used to verify and analyze 
                these processes. All speakers examined are of Muslim origin; they 
                are stratified by gender, socioeconomic status, education, age, 
                and community. Some of these indicate correlation with degree 
                of bilingualism and language contact. Most speakers are from a 
                town in Israel, and a smaller control group is from the urban 
                West Bank. <br>
                <br>
                These phenomena may be analyzed as changes in progress, because 
                their results resemble features of Israeli Hebrew, with which 
                PASII is in contact, varying by age. We will report on an acoustic

                and social factors, and explain the results in light of PASII 
                being a language closely in contact with Hebrew, while also being 
                a variety of Arabic used alongside a standard in a diglossic context.

                of seven high school and college students of Korean heritage currently 
                living in the U.S. Data sources are interviews, combined with 
                audio-tapings and observations of these students' weekly basketball 
                games. Data analysis demonstrates that for these students, Korean 
                serves as the most salient marker of in-group membership. However, 
                code-switching occurs in inter-group contexts to accommodate non-Korean 
                speakers and in intra-group contexts to facilitate communication 
                and negotiate interpersonal interactions. The participants' language 
                use and attitudes toward Korean and English reflect a negotiated 
                ethnic identity in which bilingualism plays a central role, allowing 
                both a differentiation from and an integration into the larger 
                mainstream U.S. culture.</font></p>

                <br>
                This paper develops a theoretical basis for critiquing 'voice' 
                in public culture. The project grows out of sociolinguistic work 
                on the role of dialectal variation in cultural struggles over 
                identity and power, understanding public discourse as an articulation 
                of the hegemonic and the resistant possibilities of speech. Despite 
                sociolinguistic attention to the role of standard and non-standard 
                language in public discourse and the huge literature on film, 
                few researchers have looked at the meaning of speech form in cinema. 
                This paper looks at Hollywood's representation of Native American 
                voices to argue for a concept of 'faux language' that captures 
                the range of sociolinguistic effects speech has in film. Combining 
                the sociolinguist's attention to linguistic detail with the interpretive 
                anthropologist's attention to the broader social and semiotic 
                context within which these images/symbols are read and consumed, 
                this multi-layered approach to discourse analysis provides clues 
                for unpacking the inherently ambivalent messages of public discourse 
                in general. </font></p>

              <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This 
                paper examines the use of evidentiality as a means of negotiating 
                and constructing moral responsibility in the context of communicative 
                interactions between Nantis, an Arawakan people of Peruvian Amazonia. 
                I claim that epistemic distance, as encoded by different evidential 
                strategies (e.g. direct experience vs. hearsay), functions as 
                a pragmatic metaphor for moral responsibility in Nanti discourse. 
                By emphasizing epistemic distance through the use of particular 
                evidential strategies, Nantis can construct themselves as distant 
                from a given set of circumstances, and thereby avoid the social 
                assignment of culpability. This talk is based on the close examination 
                of transcripts of interactions among Nanti individuals that I 
                recorded between 2003 and 2005, supplemented by systematic ethnographic 
                observation.</font></p>

                <br>
                This paper presents a description and analysis of contact-induced 
                change in a sub-dialect of Burushaski (JKB), spoken in Jammu & 
                Kashmir, India. JKB has been in isolation from the mainstream 
                Burushaski community in Pakistan for 115 years and has developed 
                divergent linguistic features. Many of these features can be explained 
                in terms of contact. The study has been done from a text-and-discourse-centered 
                approach. The database consists of digitally recorded natural 
                conversations, stories, narratives, elicited words, sentences 
                and field notes. <br>
                <br>
                Most sociolinguistic studies on Burushaski are fairly recent and 
                not many deal with language contact and contact-induced change 
                in detail. The language has been greatly influenced by neighboring 
                languages. Pakistan varieties of Burushaski are surrounded and 
                influenced by Indo-European, Tibeto-Burman, and Altaic languages. 
                JKB is in contact with Indo-Aryan (Urdu and Kashmiri). My analyses 
                cover various linguistic consequences of contact in JKB, viz., 
                borrowing, innovation, restructuring and simplification of linguistic 
                features. </font></p>

              <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 
                this paper I will present empirical evidence from code-switching 
                in Quechua-Spanish to argue that switching between the two codes 
                enables a diglossic performance in the two languages; Spanish 
                indexing a (H), power/status, function and Quechua indexing a 
                (L), solidarity, function. The functional alignment of this diglossic 
                use is accompanied, and complicated, by a change in footing; however, 
                the switching from Quechua to Spanish is only guaranteed if and 
                only if the text in context introduces the variable of power, 
                understood in terms of asymmetrical relations between actors or 
                salience/importance of the message. This analysis is based on 
                data from traditional stories and personal narratives which form 
                part of a corpus collected by Urioste in Cochabamba (Bolivia). 
                The matrix language in these narratives is Quechua, and the embedded 
                language is Spanish. The switches from Quechua to Spanish in these 
                narratives are both intra- and intersentential. However, for this 
                study I restrict the discussion to intersentential code-switching.</font></p>

                sociolinguistic mechanisms that underlie the discursive representation 
                of social actors and events involved in these cases. The research 
                question that guides our investigation is: What are the different 
                sociolinguistic methods and linguistic tools used by trial lawyers-prosecution 
                and defense-who take the same event, the same defendant and victim(s), 
                the same evidence and witnesses, and yet create two opposing discourses. 
                I will present evidence from three cases; a murder, a sexual abuse, 
                and a controlled substance case, to claim, following van Leeuwen 
                (2002), that lawyers systematically manipulate the linguistic 
                terms they use to refer to the defendant and the victim(s) of

                This study analyzed written learning tasks called 'quests' in 
                Quest Atlantis, a 3-D multi-user educational environment designed 
                for children aged 9-12. The quests were reviewed by a classroom 
                teacher ('teacher'), other students in the class ('class'), or 
                any student participating in Quest Atlantis ('community'). A semi-random 
                sample of 112 quests and 217 reviews was analyzed for language 
                complexity and standardness, controlling for gender and the difficulty 
                of the quest. The findings reveal gender differences in the types 
                of quests and reviews submitted, as well as in language complexity 
                and standardness. Overall, females used more standard language, 
                but males submitted quests of greater difficulty, and more community 
                quest reviews than did females. We propose an interpretation of 
                these findings in terms of developmental differences, which favor 
                girls, and gender differences in socialization, which favor boys. 
                Boys interpreted the environment as more 'game-like' than did

                paper compares popular language ideologies surrounding two surface-similar 
                cases of linguistic borrowing and mixing in Norway, "Kebab Norwegian" 
                and "knot". Both of these involve the use of distinctive linguistic 
                forms by non-native speakers: "Kebab Norwegian" incorporates words 
                from a variety of non-European immigrant languages (e.g., Arabic, 
                Kurdish, Urdu), while "knot" is the use of local or regional Norwegian 
                dialects by speakers without perceived legitimate access. In this 
                paper "Kebab Norwegian" is considered as innovative social and 
                linguistic practice in light of recent research on similar practices 
                among urban youth elsewhere in Europe, as well as in relation 
                to recent work on linguistic appropriation. Comparisons are made 
                between attitudes toward and ideological interpretations of "Kebab 
                Norwegian" and "knot," especially as they relate to issues of 
                identity, authenticity, and legitimacy of speakers. In addition, 
                some of the historical and political circumstances contributing 
                to the development of these two differentially-valued sociolinguistic

                The study of adolescence in language and culture research has 
                undergone a profound transformation: the peer group has replaced 
                adulthood as the standard by which to measure teen culture. This 
                shift has resulted in considerable scholarship on how peer groups 
                influence communicative practices during adolescence. Yet relatively 
                little is known about how peer communication contributes to the 
                shift from adolescence to adulthood. This paper analyzes communicative 
                practices among older female teens (17-18) to observe the influence 
                of the peer group at the onset of adulthood. I argue that although 
                the peer group is central to encouraging transgressive verbal 
                styles during early adolescence (13-16), it is also central to 
                exerting social pressure on girls to abandon these styles as they 
                move into adulthood. This paper contributes to the comparative 
                study of peer groups and communication at the onset of adulthood.</font></p>

                This paper examines Germany's transitional period from a suppressive

                greetings, which represent instances of rapid shifts in language

                settings over historical time. The paper addresses the effects 
                of these political changes on novices', i.e. students', national 
                identity formation processes. Analysis reveals that language socialization 
                practices today are very much alike in former East and West Berlin 
                and similar to the previous informal Western standards. Moreover, 
                these collaboratively and consistently enacted teacher-student 
                practices reinforce understandings of what it means to be a German 
                student as well as a German citizen. Rather than identify with 
                the traditional German ideals of love for order, discipline, and 
                obedience, students today learn to identify themselves as independent

              <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Over 
                the past three decades, China has been undergoing the transition 
                from a state planned economy to an increasingly globalized market 
                economy. The unprecedented socioeconomic changes have left their 
                impact on Putonghua, the standard variety of Mandarin in Mainland 
                China. My previous research has shown that linguistic innovation 
                does not simply reflect social change but can be used to effect 
                new social distinctions (Zhang 2005). In this study, I examine 
                the linguistic practice of two hosts of a television shopping 
                program and extend the investigation of linguistic innovation 
                to include phonological, lexical, and grammatical features. The 
                television program, "S-Information Station," promotes a new cosmopolitan 
                middle-class lifestyle through consumption. The study shows that 
                the two hosts use a range of innovative features to construct 
                a "cosmopolitan Mandarin style." They draw on linguistic resources 
                from Putonghua, non-Mainland Mandarin varieties, particularly 
                Taiwan Mandarin, and English. In contrast to the state-sanctioned 
                Putonghua which is a regional (i.e., Mainland China) variety, 
                the cosmopolitan style of Mandarin is distinctively non-conventional 
                and non-local. The new style is indexical and iconic of the trendy 
                and cosmopolitan persona presented by the hosts. The study proposes 
                that the wide circulation of the new Mandarin style in the broadcasting
                media reinforces and reproduces the association between the new 
                style and a set of media and social personae that display characterological 
                attributes of being glamorous, cosmopolitan, cool, trendy, and 
                not-traditional. Thus, mass media plays a significant role in 
                the "enregisterment" (Agha 2003) of the new cosmopolitan style 
                by valorizing the characterological attributes mentioned above. 
                Despite the "Common Language Law" which decrees that the broadcasting 
                media adhere to the norms of Putonghua, programs such as "S-Information 
                Station" have become a driving force in the propagation of linguistic 
                innovation in Mainland China.</font></p>
